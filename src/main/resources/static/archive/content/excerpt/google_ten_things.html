    1. Focus on the user and all else will follow.
</p>

<p>
    Since the beginning, we’ve focused on providing the best user experience possible. Whether we’re designing a new Internet browser or a new tweak to the look of the homepage, we take great care to ensure that they will ultimately serve you, rather than our own internal goal or bottom line.<sub>笔记：所做之改变，并非基于公司之利益，而是基于用户之便宜。</sub> Our homepage interface is clear and simple, and pages load instantly.<sub>笔记：对比国内之众多网站，广告横行。</sub> Placement in search results is never sold to anyone, and advertising is not only clearly marked as such, it offers relevant content and is not distracting.<sub>笔记：君子爱财，取之有道。广告之投放，不能喧宾夺主。</sub> And when we build new tools and applications, we believe they should work so well you don’t have to consider how they might have been designed differently.<sub>笔记：无论使用技术如何变换，呈现给用户的界面是一致的。</sub>
</p>

<p>
    2. It’s best to do one thing really, really well.
</p>

<p>
    We do search. With one of the world’s largest research groups focused exclusively on solving search problems, we know what we do well,<sub>笔记：明白自己的优势</sub> and how we could do it better.<sub>笔记：也明白如何巩固自己的优势</sub> Through continued iteration on difficult problems, we’ve been able to solve complex issues and provide continuous improvements to a service that already makes finding information a fast and seamless experience for millions of people. Our dedication to improving search helps us apply what we’ve learned to new products, like Gmail and Google Maps.<sub>笔记：这种优势可以推广到其它产品上</sub> Our hope is to bring the power of search to previously unexplored areas, and to help people access and use even more of the ever-expanding<sub>单词：不断增多的</sub> information in their lives.
</p>

<p>
    3. Fast is better than slow.
</p>

<p>
    We know your time is valuable, so when you’re seeking an answer on the web you want it right away–and we aim to please. We may be the only people in the world who can say our goal is to have people leave our website as quickly as possible. By shaving excess bits and bytes from our pages and increasing the efficiency of our serving environment, we’ve broken our own speed records many times over, so that the average response time on a search result is a fraction of a second. We keep speed in mind with each new product we release, whether it’s a mobile application or Google Chrome, a browser designed to be fast enough for the modern web. And we continue to work on making it all go even faster.
</p>

<p>
    4. Democracy on the web works.
</p>

<p>
    Google search works because it relies on the millions of individuals posting links on websites to help determine which other sites offer content of value.<sub>笔记：在Google Search当中，一个网页有很大价值，并非是由于Google公司一厢情愿的认为它有价值，而是因为有许多的其他的网页提及这个网页，才让这个网页有很大价值。借用火影的句子“并不是成为了火影才被大家所认可，而是被大家认可的人才能成为火影”。Google在这里使用的词是Democracy，可能想表达的意思是：被其他许多网页都认为有价值的网页，才是真正有价值的网页。</sub> We assess the importance of every web page using more than 200 signals and a variety of techniques, including our patented PageRank™ algorithm, which analyzes which sites have been “voted” to be the best sources of information by other pages across the web. As the web gets bigger, this approach actually improves, as each new site is another point of information and another vote to be counted. In the same vein,<sub>以同样的方式</sub> we are active in open source software development, where innovation takes place through the collective effort of many programmers.
</p>

<p>
    5. You don’t need to be at your desk to need an answer.
</p>

<p>
    The world is increasingly mobile: people want access to information wherever they are, whenever they need it. We’re pioneering new technologies and offering new solutions for mobile services that help people all over the globe to do any number of tasks on their phone, from checking email and calendar events to watching videos, not to mention the several different ways to access Google search on a phone. In addition, we’re hoping to fuel greater innovation for mobile users everywhere with Android, a free, open source mobile platform. Android brings the openness that shaped the Internet to the mobile world.<sub>笔记：Android改变了mobile world的格局</sub> Not only does Android benefit consumers, who have more choice and innovative new mobile experiences,<sub>笔记：Android不仅方便了普通用户</sub> but it opens up revenue opportunities for carriers, manufacturers and developers.<sub>笔记：还给通信公司、手机制造商、开发者带来了赚钱的机遇</sub>
</p>

<p>
    6. You can make money without doing evil.
</p>

<p>
    Google is a business. The revenue we generate is derived from offering search technology to companies<sub>笔记：一部分收入，来自于为其他公司提供搜索服务</sub> and from the sale of advertising displayed on our site and on other sites across the web.<sub>笔记：另一部分收入，来自于广告</sub> Hundreds of thousands of advertisers worldwide use AdWords to promote their products;<sub>笔记：Adwords，中文含义为“广告关键字”，是依据用户Google搜索的关键字来提供广告。</sub> hundreds of thousands of publishers take advantage of our AdSense program to deliver ads relevant to their site content.<sub>笔记：AdSense是个合成词。其中ad是“广告”之意，sense是“感知”之意，综合起来的意思就是相关广告。Google通过程序来分析网站的内容，并且投放与网站内容相关的广告。</sub> To ensure that we’re ultimately serving all our users (whether they are advertisers or not), we have a set of guiding principles for our advertising programs and practices:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>We don’t allow ads to be displayed on our results pages unless they are relevant where they are shown. And we firmly believe that ads can provide useful information if, and only if, they are relevant to what you wish to find–so it’s possible that certain searches won’t lead to any ads at all.</li>
    <li>We believe that advertising can be effective without being flashy.<sub>笔记：对广告的展现形式有要求</sub> We don’t accept pop–up advertising, which interferes with your ability to see the content you’ve requested. We’ve found that text ads that are relevant to the person reading them draw much higher clickthrough rates than ads appearing randomly. Any advertiser, whether small or large, can take advantage of this highly targeted medium.</li>
    <li>Advertising on Google is always clearly identified as a “Sponsored Link,” so it does not compromise the integrity of our search results. We never manipulate rankings to put our partners higher in our search results and no one can buy better PageRank. Our users trust our objectivity<sub>笔记：用户，与Google的目标之间，建立了一种信任关系</sub> and no short-term gain could ever justify breaching that trust.<sub>笔记：任何短期利益，过去不能，现在不能，将来也不能，成为损害“用户信任”的借口。</sub></li>
</ul>

    <p>
        AdWords与AdSense最主要的区别：面向的用户群体不同，AdWords是针对广告商的，而AdSense是针对发布商的。企业采用AdWords为网站带来流量，并希望流量能转化为销售。广告商为每次广告点击支付一定的费用。AdSense让发布商通过赚取展示在其内容旁边的AdWords广告费用，使其网站或博客盈利。每次点击这些广告时，发布商都要进行付款。如果你的网站有足够多的访问者，那么这就是一个从内容上产生利益流的很简单的方法。AdWords与AdSense还有什么别的不同之处吗? 从时间角度来看，AdWords存在的时间比较长。谷歌2000年建立了AdWords，而AdSense是2003年开始的。

    7. There’s always more information out there.
</p>

<p>
    Once we’d indexed more of the HTML pages on the Internet than any other search service, our engineers turned their attention to information that was not as readily accessible.<sub>笔记：Google相信，总是有更多类型的信息，可以纳入搜索引擎的研究领域。例如，起初只是HTML页面。</sub> Sometimes it was just a matter of integrating new databases into search, such as adding a phone number and address lookup<sub>电话号码和地址查询</sub> and a business directory<sub>公司业务查询</sub>. Other efforts required a bit more creativity, like adding the ability to search news archives<sub>档案</sub>, patents<sub>专利</sub>, academic journals<sub>学术期刊</sub>, billions of images<sub>图片</sub> and millions of books<sub>书籍</sub>. And our researchers continue looking into ways to bring all the world’s information to people seeking answers.
</p>

<p>
    8. The need for information crosses all borders.
</p>

<p>
    Our company was founded in California, but our mission is to facilitate access to information for the entire world, and in every language. To that end, we have offices in more than 60 countries, maintain more than 180 Internet domains, and serve more than half of our results to people living outside the United States. We offer Google’s search interface in more than 130 languages, offer people the ability to restrict results to content written in their own language, and aim to provide the rest of our applications and products in as many languages and accessible formats as possible. Using our translation tools, people can discover content written on the other side of the world in languages they don’t speak. With these tools and the help of volunteer translators, we have been able to greatly improve both the variety and quality of services we can offer in even the most far–flung corners of the globe.

    9. You can be serious without a suit.<sub>不穿西装，也可以谈正事，也可以进行严谨的思考</sub>
</p>

<p>
    Our founders built Google around the idea that work should be challenging, and the challenge should be fun. We believe that great, creative things are more likely to happen with the right company culture–and that doesn’t just mean lava lamps and rubber balls.<sub>笔记：有创造性的事物，更有可能萌发于“正确的”公司文化当中</sub> There is an emphasis on team achievements and pride in individual accomplishments that contribute to our overall success. We put great stock in our employees–energetic, passionate people from diverse backgrounds with creative approaches to work, play and life. Our atmosphere may be casual, but as new ideas emerge in a café line, at a team meeting or at the gym, they are traded<sub>单词：这里trade是指不同的人交换自己的想法</sub>, tested and put into practice with dizzying speed–and they may be the launch pad<sub>笔记：launch pad，直译是“航天器发射平台”，引申意是“重大成功或进展的起点”</sub> for a new project destined for worldwide use.
</p>

<p>
    10. Great just isn’t good enough.
</p>

<p>
    We see being great at something as a starting point, not an endpoint. We set ourselves goals we know we can’t reach yet, because we know that by stretching to meet them we can get further than we expected. Through innovation and iteration, we aim to take things that work well and improve upon them in unexpected ways. For example, when one of our engineers saw that search worked well for properly spelled words, he wondered about how it handled typos. That led him to create an intuitive and more helpful spell checker.
</p>

<p>
    Even if you don’t know exactly what you’re looking for, finding an answer on the web is our problem, not yours. We try to anticipate needs not yet articulated by our global audience, and meet them with products and services that set new standards. When we launched Gmail, it had more storage space than any email service available. In retrospect offering that seems obvious–but that’s because now we have new standards for email storage. Those are the kinds of changes we seek to make, and we’re always looking for new places where we can make a difference. Ultimately, our constant dissatisfaction with the way things are becomes the driving force behind everything we do.
