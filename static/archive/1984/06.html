<p class="indented">
    Winston was writing in his diary:
</p>

<p class="indented">
    <i>
        It was three years ago. It was on a dark evening, in a
        narrow side-street<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">小路；小街a less important street leading off a road in a town</sub> near one of the big railway stations. She
        was standing near a doorway in the wall, under a street lamp<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">灯 a device that uses electricity, oil or gas to produce light</sub>
        that hardly gave any light. She had a young face, painted<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">往（指甲、嘴唇等上）施化妆品；染（指甲）；涂（唇膏）to put coloured make-up on your nails, lips, etc.</sub>
        very thick. It was really the paint that appealed to me, the
        whiteness of it, like a mask, and the bright red lips. Party
        women never paint their faces. There was nobody else in the
        street, and no telescreens. She said two dollars. I——

<p class="indented">
    For the moment it was too difficult to go on. He shut his
    eyes and pressed his fingers against them, trying to squeeze
    out the vision that kept recurring. He had an almost overwhelming
    temptation to shout a string of filthy words at the
    top of his voice. Or to bang his head against the wall, to kick
    over the table, and hurl the inkpot through the window—to
    do any violent or noisy or painful thing that might black
    out the memory that was tormenting him.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    <strong>Your worst enemy, he reflected, was your own nervous
    system. At any moment the tension inside you was liable to
    translate itself into some visible symptom.</strong> He thought of
    a man whom he had passed in the street a few weeks back;
    a quite ordinary-looking man, a Party member, aged thirty-five
    to forty, tallish and thin, carrying a brief-case. They
    were a few metres apart when the left side of the man's face
    was suddenly contorted<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">扭曲，走样to become twisted or make sth twisted out of its natural or normal shape</sub> by a sort of spasm<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">痉挛；抽搐a sudden and often painful contracting of a muscle, which you cannot control</sub>. It happened
    again just as they were passing one another: it was only a
    twitch, a quiver, rapid as the clicking of a camera shutter,
    but obviously habitual. He remembered thinking at the
    time: That poor devil is done for. And what was frightening
    was that the action was quite possibly unconscious. The
    most deadly danger of all was talking in your sleep. There
    was no way of guarding against that, so far as he could see.

<p class="indented">
    He drew his breath and went on writing:
</p>

<p class="indented">
    <i>
        I went with her through the doorway and across a backyard
        into a basement kitchen. There was a bed against the wall,
        and a lamp on the table, turned down very low. She——
    </i>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    His teeth were set on edge. He would have liked to spit.
    Simultaneously with the woman in the basement kitchen
    he thought of Katharine, his wife. Winston was married—
    had been married, at any rate: probably he still was married,
    so far as he knew his wife was not dead. He seemed to
    breathe again the warm stuffy odour of the basement kitchen,
    an odour compounded of bugs and dirty clothes and
    villainous<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">邪恶的；可憎的very evil; very unpleasant</sub> cheap scent<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">香水a liquid with a pleasant smell that you wear on your skin to make it smell nice</sub>, but nevertheless alluring, because
    no woman of the Party ever used scent, or could be imagined
    as doing so. Only the proles used scent. In his mind the
    smell of it was inextricably<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">无法分开的；分不开的too closely linked to be separated</sub> mixed up with fornication<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">通奸；私通；婚外性行为 sexual intercourse between two consenting adults who are not married to each other</sub>.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    When he had gone with that woman it had been his first
    lapse<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">行为失检；（平时表现不错的人一时的）失足 an example or period of bad behaviour from sb who normally behaves well</sub> in two years or thereabouts. Consorting with prostitutes<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">卖淫者；娼妓；妓女；男妓a person who has sex for money</sub>
    was forbidden, of course, but it was one of those rules
    that you could occasionally nerve<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">鼓足勇气；振作精神 to give yourself the courage or strength to do sth</sub> yourself to break. It was
    dangerous, but it was not a life-and-death matter. To be
    caught with a prostitute might mean five years in a forced-labour
    camp: not more, if you had committed no other
    offence. And it was easy enough, provided that you could
    avoid being caught in the act. The poorer quarters swarmed<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">成群地来回移动to move around in a large group</sub>
    with women who were ready to sell themselves. Some could
    even be purchased for a bottle of gin, which the proles were
    not supposed to drink. Tacitly<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">心照不宣地；默认</sub> the Party was even inclined
    to encourage prostitution, as an outlet for instincts which
    could not be altogether suppressed. Mere debauchery<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">道德败坏；淫荡；沉湎酒色（或毒品）immoral behaviour involving sex, alcohol or drugs</sub> did
    not matter very much, so long as it was furtive<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">偷偷摸摸的；鬼鬼祟祟的；遮遮掩掩的behaving in a way that shows that you want to keep sth secret and do not want to be noticed</sub> and joyless
    and only involved the women of a submerged and despised
    class. The unforgivable crime was promiscuity<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">性乱行为</sub> between
    Party members. But—though this was one of the crimes
    that the accused in the great purges invariably confessed
    to—it was difficult to imagine any such thing actually happening.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    The aim of the Party was not merely to prevent men and
    women from forming loyalties which it might not be able
    to control. Its real, undeclared purpose was to remove all
    pleasure from the sexual act. Not love so much as eroticism<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（尤指艺术、文学作品等中的）色情描写the fact of expressing or describing sexual feelings and desire, especially in art, literature, etc.</sub>
    was the enemy, inside marriage as well as outside it.
    All marriages between Party members had to be approved
    by a committee appointed for the purpose, and—though
    the principle was never clearly stated—permission was always
    refused if the couple concerned gave the impression
    of being physically attracted to one another. The only recognized
    purpose of marriage was to beget children for the
    service of the Party. Sexual intercourse was to be looked on
    as a slightly disgusting minor operation, like having an enema<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">灌肠剂；（尤指手术前的）灌肠a liquid that is put into a person's rectum(= the opening through which solid waste leaves the body) in order to clean out the bowels, especially before a medical operation; the act of cleaning out the bowels in this way</sub>.
    This again was never put into plain words, but in an
    indirect way it was rubbed into every Party member from
    childhood onwards. There were even organizations such
    as the Junior Anti-Sex League<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">青年反性同盟</sub>, which advocated complete
    celibacy<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">禁欲；独身(生活)</sub> for both sexes. All children were to be begotten
    by artificial insemination<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">受孕,授精</sub> (ARTSEM, it was called in Newspeak)
    and brought up in public institutions. This, Winston
    was aware, was not meant altogether seriously, but somehow
    it fitted in with the general ideology of the Party. The
    Party was trying to kill the sex instinct, or, <strong>if it could not be
    killed, then to distort it and dirty it</strong>. He did not know why
    this was so, but it seemed natural that it should be so. And
    as far as the women were concerned, the Party's efforts were
    largely successful.

<p class="indented">
    He thought again of Katharine. It must be nine, ten—nearly
    eleven years since they had parted. It was curious
    how seldom he thought of her. For days at a time he was capable
    of forgetting that he had ever been married. They had
    only been together for about fifteen months. The Party did
    not permit divorce, but it rather encouraged separation in
    cases where there were no children.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Katharine was a tall, fair-haired girl, very straight<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">规矩老实的；本分无趣的；正统的you can use straight to describe a person who is normal and ordinary, but who you consider dull and boring</sub>, with
    splendid movements. She had a bold, aquiline<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">钩状的；鹰喙状的</sub> face, a face
    that one might have called noble until one discovered that
    there was as nearly as possible nothing behind it. Very early
    in her married life he had decided—though perhaps it was
    only that he knew her more intimately than he knew most
    people—that she had without exception the most stupid,
    vulgar<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">庸俗的；粗俗的；粗野的；不雅的not having or showing good taste; not polite, elegant or well behaved</sub>, empty mind that he had ever encountered. She had
    not a thought in her head that was not a slogan, and there
    was no imbecility<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">低能；愚蠢的言行</sub>, absolutely none that she was not capable
    of swallowing if the Party handed it out to her. ‘The human sound-track'<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">伴音磁迹</sub>
    he nicknamed her in his own mind. Yet
    he could have endured living with her if it had not been for
    just one thing—sex.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    As soon as he touched her she seemed to wince<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（因痛苦或尴尬）龇牙咧嘴，皱眉蹙额to suddenly make an expression with your face that shows that you are feeling pain or embarrassment</sub> and stiffen.
    To embrace her was like embracing a jointed wooden
    image. And what was strange was that even when she was
    clasping<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">抱紧；紧紧拥抱to hold sb/sth tightly with your arms around them</sub> him against her he had the feeling that she was simultaneously
    pushing him away with all her strength. The
    rigidlty of her muscles managed to convey that impression.
    She would lie there with shut eyes, neither resisting
    nor cooperating but SUBMITTING. It was extraordinarily
    embarrassing, and, after a while, horrible. But even then
    he could have borne<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">承受；忍受to be able to accept and deal with sth unpleasant</sub> living with her if it had been agreed
    that they should remain celibate<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">无性生活的；禁欲的not having sex</sub>. But curiously enough it
    was Katharine who refused this. They must, she said, produce
    a child if they could. So the performance continued to
    happen, once a week quite regularly, whenever it was not
    impossible. She even used to remind him of it in the morning,
    as something which had to be done that evening and
    which must not be forgotten. She had two names for it. One
    was ‘making a baby', and the other was ‘our duty to the Party'
    (yes, she had actually used that phrase). Quite soon he
    grew to have a feeling of positive<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">完全的；绝对的complete and definite</sub> dread when the appointed
    day came round. But luckily no child appeared, and in the
    end she agreed to give up trying, and soon afterwards they
    parted.

<p class="indented">
    Winston sighed inaudibly. He picked up his pen again
    and wrote:
</p>

<p class="indented">
    <i>
        She threw herself down on the bed, and at once, without any
        kind of preliminary<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">预备性措施 a preliminary is an action or event that is done in preparation for sth</sub> in the most coarse, horrible way you can
        imagine, pulled up her skirt. I——
    </i>
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    He saw himself standing there in the dim lamplight,
    with the smell of bugs and cheap scent in his nostrils<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">鼻孔either of the two openings at the end of the nose that you breathe through</sub>, and
    in his heart a feeling of defeat and resentment which even
    at that moment was mixed up with the thought of Katharine's
    white body, frozen for ever by the hypnotic<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">有催眠作用的；使人昏昏欲睡的making you feel as if you are going to fall asleep, especially because of a regular, repeated noise or movement</sub> power
    of the Party. Why did it always have to be like this? Why
    could he not have a woman of his own instead of these filthy
    scuffles<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（短暂而不太激烈的）肢体摩擦，冲突a short and not very violent fight or struggle</sub> at intervals<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（时间上的）间隔，间隙，间歇a period of time between two events</sub> of years? But a real love affair was an almost
    unthinkable event. The women of the Party were all
    alike. Chastity<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（性方面的）忠贞；贞洁；贞操the state of not having sex with anyone or only having sex with the person you are married to; being chaste</sub> was as deep ingrained in them as Party loyalty.
    By careful early conditioning<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">训练；熏陶；条件作用the training or experience that an animal or a person has that makes them behave in a particular way in a particular situation</sub>, by games and cold water,
    by the rubbish<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">废话；瞎说comments, ideas, etc. that you think are stupid or wrong</sub> that was dinned<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">喋喋不休地说 to fix something in somebody's mind by repeating it over and over again</sub> into them at school and in
    the Spies and the Youth League, by lectures, parades, songs,
    slogans, and martial music, the natural feeling had been
    driven out of them. His reason told him that there must be
    exceptions, but his heart did not believe it. They were all impregnable<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">难以改变的strong and impossible to defeat or change</sub>,
    as the Party intended that they should be. And
    what he wanted, more even than to be loved, was to break
    down that wall of virtue, even if it were only once in his
    whole life. The sexual act, successfully performed, was rebellion.
    Desire was thoughtcrime. Even to have awakened
    Katharine, if he could have achieved it, would have been
    like a seduction<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">诱奸the act of persuading sb to have sex with you</sub>, although she was his wife.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    But the rest of the story had got to be written down. He wrote:
</p>

<p class="indented">
    <i>
        I turned up the lamp. When I saw her in the light——
    </i>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    After the darkness the feeble<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">微弱的 very weak</sub> light of the paraffin<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">煤油 a type of oil obtained from petroleum and used as a fuel for heat and light</sub> lamp
    had seemed very bright. For the first time he could see the
    woman properly. He had taken a step towards her and then
    halted, full of lust and terror. He was painfully conscious of
    the risk he had taken in coming here. It was perfectly possible
    that the patrols would catch him on the way out: for
    that matter they might be waiting outside the door at this
    moment. If he went away without even doing what he had
    come here to do——!
</p>

<p class="indented">
    It had got to be written down, it had got to be confessed.
    What he had suddenly seen in the lamplight was that the
    woman was OLD. The paint was plastered<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">往…上涂抹to cover sb/sth with a wet or sticky substance</sub> so thick on her
    face that it looked as though it might crack like a cardboard
    mask. There were streaks<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">条纹；条痕a long thin mark or line that is a different colour from the surface it is on</sub> of white in her hair; but the truly
    dreadful detail was that her mouth had fallen a little open,
    revealing nothing except a cavernous<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">又黑又深的；像洞穴的very large and often empty and/or dark; like a cave</sub> blackness. She had no
    teeth at all.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    He wrote hurriedly, in scrabbling handwriting:
</p>

<p class="indented">
    <i>
        When I saw her in the light she was quite an old woman, fifty
        years old at least. But I went ahead and did it just the same.
    </i>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    He pressed his fingers against his eyelids again. He had
    written it down at last, but it made no difference. The therapy<sub class="my_note" style="color:red">笔记：我理解是这么回事儿，他想通过记日志的方式来发泄头脑中的那种“anger”，然而即使写了出来，也并没有减轻</sub>
    had not worked. The urge to shout filthy words at the top
    of his voice was as strong as ever.
