    It was the middle of the morning, and Winston had left
    the cubicle<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（大房间分隔出的）小房间，隔间a small room that is made by separating off part of a larger room</sub> to go to the lavatory<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">公共厕所（或卫生间、洗手间、盥洗室）a public building or part of a building, with toilets in it</sub>.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    A solitary<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">单个的；孤单的；孤零零的alone, with no other people or things around</sub> figure was coming towards him from the other
    end of the long, brightly-lit corridor. It was the girl with
    dark hair. Four days had gone past since the evening when
    he had run into her outside the junk-shop. As she came
    nearer he saw that her right arm was in a sling<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（悬吊受伤手臂的）悬带</sub>, not noticeable
    at a distance because it was of the same colour as her
    overalls. Probably she had crushed her hand while swinging
    round one of the big kaleidoscopes on which the plots
    of novels were ‘roughed in'. It was a common accident in the
    Fiction Department.

</p>

<p class="indented">
    They were perhaps four metres apart when the girl stumbled
    and fell almost flat on her face. A sharp cry of pain was
    wrung out of her. She must have fallen right on the injured
    arm. Winston stopped short. The girl had risen to her knees.
    Her face had turned a milky yellow colour against which
    her mouth stood out redder than ever. Her eyes were fixed
    on his, with an appealing<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">恳求的；可怜的；希望同情的 showing that you want people to help you or to show you pity or sympathy</sub> expression that looked more like
    fear than pain.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    A curious emotion stirred in Winston's heart. In front of
    him was an enemy who was trying to kill him: in front of
    him, also, was a human creature, in pain and perhaps with
    a broken bone. Already he had instinctively started forward
    to help her. In the moment when he had seen her fall on the
    bandaged arm, it had been as though he felt the pain in his
    own body.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘You're hurt?' he said.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘It's nothing. My arm. It'll be all right in a second.'
</p>

<p class="indented">
    She spoke as though her heart were fluttering<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">颤动to move lightly and quickly</sub>. She had
    certainly turned very pale.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘You haven't broken anything?'
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘No, I'm all right. It hurt for a moment, that's all.'
</p>

<p class="indented">
    She held out her free hand to him, and he helped her up.
    She had regained some of her colour, and appeared very
    much better.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘It's nothing,' she repeated shortly. ‘I only gave my wrist a
    bit of a bang. Thanks, comrade!'
</p>

<p class="indented">
    And with that she walked on in the direction in which
    she had been going, as briskly<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">快的；敏捷的 quick </sub> as though it had really been
    nothing. The whole incident could not have taken as much
    as half a minute. Not to let one's feelings appear in one's
    face was a habit that had acquired the status of an instinct,
    and in any case they had been standing straight in front of
    a telescreen when the thing happened. Nevertheless it had
    been very difficult not to betray a momentary surprise, for
    in the two or three seconds while he was helping her up
    the girl had slipped something into his hand. There was no
    question that she had done it intentionally. It was something
    small and flat. As he passed through the lavatory door
    he transferred it to his pocket and felt it with the tips of his
    fingers. It was a scrap<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">碎片，小块（纸、布匹等）a small piece of sth, especially paper, cloth, etc.</sub> of paper folded into a square.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    While he stood at the urinal<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（男用）小便池，小便器；男厕所a type of toilet for men that is attached to the wall; a room or building containing urinals</sub> he managed, with a little
    more fingering, to get it unfolded. Obviously there must be
    a message of some kind written on it. For a moment he was
    tempted to take it into one of the water-closets and read it
    at once. But that would be shocking folly, as he well knew.
    There was no place where you could be more certain that
    the telescreens were watched continuously.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    He went back to his cubicle, sat down, threw the fragment
    of paper casually among the other papers on the desk,
    put on his spectacles and hitched the speakwrite towards
    him. ‘Five minutes,' he told himself, ‘five minutes at the
    very least!' His heart bumped in his breast with frightening
    loudness. Fortunately the piece of work he was engaged on
    was mere routine, the rectification of a long list of figures,
    not needing close attention.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Whatever was written on the paper, it must have some
    kind of political meaning. So far as he could see there were
    two possibilities. One, much the more likely, was that the
    girl was an agent of the Thought Police, just as he had feared.
    He did not know why the Thought Police should choose to
    deliver their messages in such a fashion, but perhaps they
    had their reasons. The thing that was written on the paper
    might be a threat, a summons, an order to commit suicide,
    a trap of some description. But there was another, wilder
    possibility that kept raising its head, though he tried vainly
    to suppress it. This was, that the message did not come
    from the Thought Police at all, but from some kind of underground
    organization. Perhaps the Brotherhood existed
    after all! Perhaps the girl was part of it! No doubt the idea
    was absurd, but it had sprung into his mind in the very instant
    of feeling the scrap of paper in his hand. It was not till
    a couple of minutes later that the other, more probable explanation
    had occurred to him. And even now, though his
    intellect told him that the message probably meant death—
    still, that was not what he believed, and the unreasonable
    hope persisted, and his heart banged, and it was with difficulty
    that he kept his voice from trembling as he murmured
    his figures into the speakwrite.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    He rolled up the completed bundle of work and slid it
    into the pneumatic<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">由压缩空气操作的；气动的；风动的worked by air under pressure</sub> tube. Eight minutes had gone by. He readjusted
    his spectacles on his nose, sighed, and drew the
    next batch of work towards him, with the scrap of paper on
    top of it. He flattened it out. On it was written, in a large unformed handwriting:
</p>

<p class="indented">
    <i>I LOVE YOU.</i>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    For several seconds he was too stunned even to throw
    the incriminating<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">显示有罪的
    to prove or make somebody appear to be guilty of a crime or mistake</sub> thing into the memory hole. When he
    did so, although he knew very well the danger of showing
    too much interest, he could not resist reading it once again,
    just to make sure that the words were really there.

<p class="indented">
    For the rest of the morning it was very difficult to work.
    What was even worse than having to focus his mind on a
    series of niggling<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">不重要的；微不足道的 not important</sub> jobs was the need to conceal his agitation<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">焦虑不安；忧虑；烦乱 worry and anxiety that you show by behaving in a nervous way</sub>
    from the telescreen. He felt as though a fire were burning
    in his belly. Lunch in the hot, crowded, noise-filled canteen
    was torment. He had hoped to be alone for a little while
    during the lunch hour, but as bad luck would have it the
    imbecile<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">笨蛋；蠢货 a rude way to describe a person that you think is very stupid</sub> Parsons flopped<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（沉重、笨拙或不由自主地）落下，移动，悬挂 to fall, move or hang in a heavy or awkward way, without control</sub> down beside him, the tang<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">强烈味道；刺鼻气味 a strong sharp taste or smell</sub> of his
    sweat almost defeating the tinny smell of stew, and kept up
    a stream of talk about the preparations for Hate Week. He
    was particularly enthusiastic about a papier-mache<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">纸糊的材料</sub> model of
    Big Brother's head, two metres wide, which was being made
    for the occasion by his daughter's troop of Spies. The irritating
    thing was that in the racket<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">喧哗；吵闹 a loud unpleasant noise</sub> of voices Winston could
    hardly hear what Parsons was saying, and was constantly
    having to ask for some fatuous<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">愚蠢的；愚昧的 stupid</sub> remark to be repeated. Just
    once he caught a glimpse of the girl, at a table with two other
    girls at the far end of the room. She appeared not to have
    seen him, and he did not look in that direction again.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    The afternoon was more bearable<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">可忍受的；能应付的 a person or thing that isbearable can be accepted or dealt with</sub>. Immediately after lunch
    there arrived a delicate, difficult piece of work which would
    take several hours and necessitated putting everything else
    aside. It consisted in falsifying a series of production reports
    of two years ago, in such a way as to cast discredit on a
    prominent member of the Inner Party, who was now under
    a cloud. This was the kind of thing that Winston was good
    at, and for more than two hours he succeeded in shutting
    the girl out of his mind altogether. Then the memory of her
    face came back, and with it a raging<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">极其强大的；猛烈的 very powerful</sub>, intolerable desire to
    be alone. Until he could be alone it was impossible to think
    this new development out. Tonight was one of his nights at
    the Community Centre. He wolfed<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">大口地快吃</sub> another tasteless meal
    in the canteen, hurried off to the Centre, took part in the
    solemn foolery of a ‘discussion group', played two games
    of table tennis, swallowed several glasses of gin, and sat for
    half an hour through a lecture entitled ‘Ingsoc in relation to
    chess'. His soul writhed<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（常指因剧痛不停地）扭动，翻滚 to twist or move your body without stopping, often because you are in great pain</sub> with boredom, but for once he had
    had no impulse to shirk<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">逃避（工作）；躲懒 to avoid doing sth you should do, especially because you are too lazy</sub> his evening at the Centre. At the
    sight of the words I LOVE YOU the desire to stay alive had
    welled up in him, and the taking of minor risks suddenly
    seemed stupid. It was not till twenty-three hours, when he
    was home and in bed—in the darkness, where you were safe
    even from the telescreen so long as you kept silent—that he
    was able to think continuously.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>

<p class="indented">
    It was a physical problem that had to be solved: how to
    get in touch with the girl and arrange a meeting. He did
    not consider any longer the possibility that she might be
    laying some kind of trap for him. He knew that it was not
    so, because of her unmistakable agitation when she handed
    him the note. Obviously she had been frightened out of her
    wits, as well she might be. Nor did the idea of refusing her
    advances even cross his mind. Only five nights ago he had
    contemplated smashing her skull in with a cobblestone, but
    that was of no importance. He thought of her naked, youthful
    body, as he had seen it in his dream. He had imagined
    her a fool like all the rest of them, her head stuffed with lies
    and hatred, her belly full of ice. A kind of fever seized him at
    the thought that he might lose her, the white youthful body
    might slip away from him! What he feared more than anything
    else was that she would simply change her mind if he
    did not get in touch with her quickly. But the physical difficulty
    of meeting was enormous. It was like trying to make
    a move at chess when you were already mated<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">【象棋】逼将，将军</sub>. Whichever
    way you turned, the telescreen faced you. Actually, all the
    possible ways of communicating with her had occurred to
    him within five minutes of reading the note; but now, with
    time to think, he went over them one by one, as though laying
    out a row of instruments on a table.
    <sub class="my_note" style="color:green">笔记：我心中有莫名的伤感，可能是觉得，他不会有一个好的结局。因为在这样一个环境当中，他找不到自我存活的突破口。我有一种猜测，那个黑发女孩的I love you是设计的一个陷阱。</sub>

<p class="indented">
    Obviously the kind of encounter that had happened this
    morning could not be repeated. If she had worked in the Records
    Department it might have been comparatively simple,
    but he had only a very dim idea whereabouts in the building
    the Fiction Department lay, and he had no pretext for going
    there. If he had known where she lived, and at what time
    she left work, he could have contrived to meet her somewhere
    on her way home; but to try to follow her home was
    not safe, because it would mean loitering<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">闲站着；闲荡；徘徊 to stand or wait somewhere especially with no obvious reason</sub> about outside the
    Ministry, which was bound to be noticed. As for sending
    a letter through the mails, it was out of the question. By
    a routine that was not even secret, all letters were opened
    in transit. Actually, few people ever wrote letters. For the
    messages that it was occasionally necessary to send, there
    were printed postcards with long lists of phrases, and you
    struck out the ones that were inapplicable. In any case he
    did not know the girl's name, let alone her address. Finally
    he decided that the safest place was the canteen. If he
    could get her at a table by herself, somewhere in the middle
    of the room, not too near the telescreens, and with a sufficient
    buzz<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">发出嗡嗡声 to make a continuous low sound</sub> of conversation all round—if these conditions
    endured for, say, thirty seconds, it might be possible to exchange a few words.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    For a week after this, life was like a restless dream. On
    the next day she did not appear in the canteen until he
    was leaving it, the whistle having already blown. Presumably<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">很可能；大概；想必是used to say that you think that sth is probably true</sub>
    she had been changed on to a later shift. They passed
    each other without a glance. On the day after that she was
    in the canteen at the usual time, but with three other girls
    and immediately under a telescreen. Then for three dreadful
    days she did not appear at all. His whole mind and body
    seemed to be afflicted with an unbearable sensitivity, a sort
    of transparency, which made every movement, every sound,
    every contact, every word that he had to speak or listen
    to, an agony. Even in sleep he could not altogether escape
    from her image. He did not touch the diary during those
    days. If there was any relief, it was in his work, in which he
    could sometimes forget himself for ten minutes at a stretch.
    He had absolutely no clue as to what had happened to her.
    There was no enquiry<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">询问；打听a request for information about sb/sth; a question about sb/sth</sub> he could make. She might have been
    vaporized, she might have committed suicide, she might
    have been transferred to the other end of Oceania: worst
    and likeliest of all, she might simply have changed her mind
    and decided to avoid him.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    The next day she reappeared. Her arm was out of the sling<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（悬吊受伤手臂的）悬带，吊腕带 a band of cloth that is tied around a person's neck and used to support a broken or injured arm</sub>
    and she had a band of sticking-plaster round her wrist. The
    relief of seeing her was so great that he could not resist staring
    directly at her for several seconds. On the following day
    he very nearly succeeded in speaking to her. When he came
    into the canteen she was sitting at a table well out from the
    wall, and was quite alone. It was early, and the place was
    not very full. The queue edged forward till Winston was
    almost at the counter, then was held up for two minutes
    because someone in front was complaining that he had not
    received his tablet of saccharine. But the girl was still alone
    when Winston secured his tray and began to make for her
    table. He walked casually towards her, his eyes searching
    for a place at some table beyond her. She was perhaps three
    metres away from him. Another two seconds would do it.
    Then a voice behind him called, ‘Smith!' He pretended not
    to hear. ‘Smith!' repeated the voice, more loudly. It was no
    use. He turned round. A blond-headed, silly-faced young
    man named Wilsher, whom he barely knew, was inviting
    him with a smile to a vacant place at his table. It was not
    safe to refuse. After having been recognized, he could not
    go and sit at a table with an unattended<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">主人不在场的；无人看管（或照料）的without the owner present; not being watched or cared for</sub> girl. It was too noticeable.
    He sat down with a friendly smile. The silly blond
    face beamed into his. Winston had a hallucination<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">幻视（或幻听）到的东西；幻觉；幻象something that is seen or heard when it is not really there</sub> of himself
    smashing a pick-axe right into the middle of it. The
    girl's table filled up a few minutes later.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    But she must have seen him coming towards her, and
    perhaps she would take the hint. Next day he took care to
    arrive early. Surely enough, she was at a table in about the
    same place, and again alone. The person immediately ahead
    of him in the queue was a small, swiftly-moving, beetle-like
    man with a flat face and tiny, suspicious eyes. As Winston
    turned away from the counter with his tray, he saw that the
    little man was making straight for the girl's table. His hopes
    sank again. There was a vacant place at a table further away,
    but something in the little man's appearance suggested
    that he would be sufficiently attentive to his own comfort
    to choose the emptiest table. With ice at his heart Winston
    followed. It was no use unless he could get the girl alone.
    At this moment there was a tremendous crash. The little
    man was sprawling on all fours, his tray had gone flying,
    two streams of soup and coffee were flowing across the floor.
    He started to his feet with a malignant<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">恶意的；恶毒的having or showing a strong desire to harm sb</sub> glance at Winston,
    whom he evidently suspected of having tripped him up. But
    it was all right. Five seconds later, with a thundering heart,
    Winston was sitting at the girl's table.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    He did not look at her. He unpacked his tray and promptly
    began eating. It was all-important to speak at once,
    before anyone else came, but now a terrible fear had taken
    possession of him. A week had gone by since she had first
    approached him. She would have changed her mind, she
    must have changed her mind! It was impossible that this affair
    should end successfully; such things did not happen in
    real life. He might have flinched<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（突然）退缩；畏缩 to make a sudden movement with your face or body as a result of pain, fear, surprise, etc.</sub> altogether from speaking if
    at this moment he had not seen Ampleforth, the hairy-eared
    poet, wandering limply round the room with a tray, looking
    for a place to sit down. In his vague way Ampleforth
    was attached to Winston, and would certainly sit down at
    his table if he caught sight of him. There was perhaps a minute
    in which to act. Both Winston and the girl were eating
    steadily. The stuff they were eating was a thin stew, actually
    a soup, of haricot<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">菜豆；芸豆；扁豆 a type of small white bean that is usually dried before it is sold and then left in water before cooking</sub> beans. In a low murmur Winston began
    speaking. Neither of them looked up; steadily they spooned
    the watery stuff into their mouths, and between spoonfuls
    exchanged the few necessary words in low expressionless
    voices.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘What time do you leave work?'
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Eighteen-thirty.'
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Where can we meet?'
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Victory Square, near the monument.'
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘It's full of telescreens.'
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘It doesn't matter if there's a crowd.'
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Any signal?'
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘No. Don't come up to me until you see me among a lot
    of people. And don't look at me. Just keep somewhere near
    me.'
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘What time?'
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Nineteen hours.'
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘All right.'
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Ampleforth failed to see Winston and sat down at another table.
    They did not speak again, and, so far as it was
    possible for two people sitting on opposite sides of the same
    table, they did not look at one another. The girl finished her
    lunch quickly and made off, while Winston stayed to smoke
    a cigarette.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Winston was in Victory Square before the appointed
    time. He wandered round the base of the enormous fluted<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">外部有凹槽纹的with a pattern of curves cut around the outside</sub>
    column, at the top of which Big Brother's statue gazed
    southward towards the skies where he had vanquished<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">完全征服；彻底击败；战胜to defeat sb completely in a competition, war, etc.</sub> the
    Eurasian aeroplanes (the Eastasian aeroplanes, it had been,
    a few years ago) in the Battle of Airstrip One. In the street
    in front of it there was a statue of a man on horseback which
    was supposed to represent Oliver Cromwell. At five minutes
    past the hour the girl had still not appeared. Again the terrible
    fear seized upon Winston. She was not coming, she
    had changed her mind! He walked slowly up to the north
    side of the square and got a sort of pale-coloured pleasure
    from identifying St Martin's Church, whose bells, when it
    had bells, had chimed ‘You owe me three farthings.' Then
    he saw the girl standing at the base of the monument, reading
    or pretending to read a poster which ran spirally up the
    column. It was not safe to go near her until some more people
    had accumulated. There were telescreens all round the
    pediment. But at this moment there was a din of shouting
    and a zoom of heavy vehicles from somewhere to the left.
    Suddenly everyone seemed to be running across the square.
    The girl nipped nimbly round the lions at the base of the
    monument and joined in the rush. Winston followed. As he
    ran, he gathered from some shouted remarks that a convoy<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（尤指有士兵护送的）车队，船队a group of vehicles or ships travelling together, especially when soldiers or other vehicles travel with them for protection</sub>
    of Eurasian prisoners was passing.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Already a dense mass of people was blocking the south
    side of the square. Winston, at normal times the kind of
    person who gravitates to the outer edge of any kind of
    scrimmage<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">混战；群架；你争我夺 a confused struggle or fight</sub>, shoved, butted, squirmed<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（因紧张、不舒服等）动来动去，来回扭动，坐卧不宁to move around a lot making small twisting movements, because you are nervous, uncomfortable, etc.</sub> his way forward into
    the heart of the crowd. Soon he was within arm's length of
    the girl, but the way was blocked by an enormous prole and
    an almost equally enormous woman, presumably his wife,
    who seemed to form an impenetrable wall of flesh. Winston
    wriggled<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">扭动身体；扭来扭去to twist and turn your body or part of it with quick short movements</sub> himself sideways, and with a violent lunge<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">猛冲；猛扑 a sudden powerful forward movement of the body and arm that a person makes towards another person or thing, especially when attacking or trying to take hold of them</sub>
    managed to drive his shoulder between them. For a moment it
    felt as though his entrails<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">内脏；（尤指）肠the organs inside the body of a person or an animal, especially their intestines</sub> were being ground to pulp<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">纸浆a soft substance that is made by crushing wood, cloth or other material and then used to make paper</sub> between the two muscular hips, then he had broken through,
    sweating a little. He was next to the girl. They were shoulder
    to shoulder, both staring fixedly in front of them.

<p class="indented">
    A long line of trucks, with wooden-faced guards armed
    with sub-machine guns standing upright in each corner, was
    passing slowly down the street. In the trucks little yellow
    men in shabby<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">衣着破旧的 badly dressed in clothes that have been worn a lot</sub> greenish uniforms were squatting, jammed
    close together. Their sad, Mongolian faces gazed out over
    the sides of the trucks utterly incurious<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">不感兴趣的；不好奇的；漫不经心的 having no interest in knowing or discovering things</sub>. Occasionally when
    a truck jolted<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">震动，摇动，颠簸to move or to make sb/sth move suddenly and roughly</sub> there was a clank-clank<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">发出叮当声，发出当啷声to make a loud sound like pieces of metal hitting each other; to cause sth to make this sound</sub> of metal: all the prisoners
    were wearing leg-irons<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">脚镣</sub>. Truck-load after truck-load of
    the sad faces passed. Winston knew they were there but he
    saw them only intermittently<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">断断续续的；间歇的 stopping and starting often over a period of time, but not regularly</sub>. The girl's shoulder, and her
    arm right down to the elbow, were pressed against his. Her
    cheek was almost near enough for him to feel its warmth.
    She had immediately taken charge of the situation, just as
    she had done in the canteen. She began speaking in the
    same expressionless voice as before, with lips barely moving,
    a mere murmur easily drowned by the din of voices and
    the rumbling<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">低沉而持续的声音a long deep sound or series of sounds</sub> of the trucks.

    ‘Can you hear me?'
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Yes.'
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Can you get Sunday afternoon off?'
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Yes.'
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Then listen carefully. You'll have to remember this. Go
    to Paddington Station——'
</p>

<p class="indented">
    With a sort of military precision that astonished him, she
    outlined the route that he was to follow. A half-hour railway
    journey; turn left outside the station; two kilometres along
    the road; a gate with the top bar missing; a path across a
    field; a grass-grown lane; a track between bushes; a dead
    tree with moss on it. It was as though she had a map inside
    her head. ‘Can you remember all that?' she murmured finally.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Yes.'
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘You turn left, then right, then left again. And the gate's
    got no top bar.'
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Yes. What time?'
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘About fifteen. You may have to wait. I'll get there by another
    way. Are you sure you remember everything?'
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Yes.'
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Then get away from me as quick as you can.'
</p>

<p class="indented">
    She need not have told him that. But for the moment
    they could not extricate themselves from the crowd. The
    trucks were still filing<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">排成一行行走 to walk in a line of people, one after the other, in a particular direction</sub> past, the people still insatiably gaping<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">张口结舌地看；目瞪口呆地凝视 to stare at sb/sth with your mouth open because you are shocked or surprised</sub>.
    At the start there had been a few boos and hisses, but
    it came only from the Party members among the crowd,
    and had soon stopped. The prevailing emotion was simply
    curiosity. Foreigners, whether from Eurasia or from Eastasia,
    were a kind of strange animal. One literally<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（强调事实可能令人惊讶）真正地，确实地used to emphasize the truth of sth that may seem surprising</sub> never saw
    them except in the guise of prisoners, and even as prisoners
    one never got more than a momentary glimpse of them.
    Nor did one know what became of them, apart from the
    few who were hanged as war-criminals: the others simply
    vanished, presumably into forced-labour camps. The round
    Mogol faces had given way to faces of a more European type,
    dirty, bearded and exhausted. From over scrubby cheek-bones
    eyes looked into Winston's, sometimes with strange
    intensity, and flashed away again. The convoy was drawing
    to an end. In the last truck he could see an aged man, his
    face a mass of grizzled<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（头发）灰白的，花白的having hair that is grey or partly grey</sub> hair, standing upright with wrists
    crossed in front of him, as though he were used to having
    them bound together. It was almost time for Winston and
    the girl to part. But at the last moment, while the crowd still
    hemmed them in, her hand felt for his and gave it a fleeting<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">短暂的；闪现的lasting only a short time</sub>
    squeeze.

    It could not have been ten seconds, and yet it seemed a
    long time that their hands were clasped together. He had
    time to learn every detail of her hand. He explored the long
    fingers, the shapely nails, the work-hardened palm with its
    row of callouses, the smooth flesh under the wrist. Merely
    from feeling it he would have known it by sight. In the same
    instant it occurred to him that he did not know what colour
    the girl's eyes were. They were probably brown, but people
    with dark hair sometimes had blue eyes. To turn his head
    and look at her would have been inconceivable<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">难以想象的；无法相信的impossible to imagine or believe</sub> folly. With
    hands locked together, invisible among the press of bodies,
    they stared steadily in front of them, and instead of the eyes
    of the girl, the eyes of the aged prisoner gazed mournfully
    at Winston out of nests of hair.
