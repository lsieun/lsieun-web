<p class="indented">
    Winston had woken up with his eyes full of tears.
    Julia rolled sleepily against him, murmuring something
    that might have been ‘What’s the matter?’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘I dreamt—’ he began, and stopped short. It was too complex
    to be put into words. There was the dream itself, and
    there was a memory connected with it that had swum into
    his mind in the few seconds after waking.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    He lay back with his eyes shut, still sodden in the atmosphere
    of the dream. It was a vast, luminous<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">〈文学〉美好的 very intelligent or beautiful</sub> dream in which
    his whole life seemed to stretch out before him like a landscape
    on a summer evening after rain. It had all occurred
    inside the glass paperweight, but the surface of the glass
    was the dome of the sky, and inside the dome everything
    was flooded with clear soft light in which one could see into
    interminable<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">无限的；无尽头的；无终止的 lasting a very long time and therefore boring or annoying</sub> distances. The dream had also been comprehended
    by—indeed, in some sense it had consisted in—a
    gesture of the arm made by his mother, and made again
    thirty years later by the Jewish woman he had seen on the
    news film, trying to shelter the small boy from the bullets,
    before the helicopter blew them both to pieces.

    ‘Do you know,’ he said, ‘that until this moment I believed
    I had murdered my mother?’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Why did you murder her?’ said Julia, almost asleep.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘I didn’t murder her. Not physically.’
    <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：这里的对话让我想到了一点（之前的地方也有过），其实Julia和Winston并不是同一类人，Winston的话语中有着一种“抽象”意义，而Julia的话语中则更注重“现实”。</sub>

<p class="indented">
    In the dream he had remembered his last glimpse of his
    mother, and within a few moments of waking the cluster
    of small events surrounding it had all come back. It was a
    memory that he must have deliberately pushed out of his
    consciousness over many years. He was not certain of the
    date, but he could not have been less than ten years old, possibly twelve, when it had happened.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    His father had disappeared some time earlier, how much
    earlier he could not remember. He remembered better the
    rackety<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">喧闹的</sub>, uneasy circumstances of the time: the periodical
    panics about air-raids and the sheltering in Tube stations,
    the piles of rubble<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">碎石；碎砖 broken stones or bricks from a building or wall that has been destroyed or damaged</sub> everywhere, the unintelligible<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">难以理解的；难懂的impossible to understand</sub> proclamations<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">宣言；公告；声明 an official statement about sth important that is made to the public; the act of making an official statement</sub>
    posted at street corners, the gangs of youths in
    shirts all the same colour, the enormous queues outside
    the bakeries<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">面包店</sub>, the intermittent<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">断断续续的；间歇的 stopping and starting often over a period of time, but not regularly</sub> machine-gun fire in the distance—above all,
    the fact that there was never enough to
    eat. He remembered long afternoons spent with other boys
    in scrounging<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">四处搜寻 to seek and acquire something from any available source, e.g. by foraging</sub> round dustbins and rubbish heaps, picking
    out the ribs of cabbage leaves, potato peelings, sometimes
    even scraps of stale bread crust from which they carefully
    scraped away the cinders<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">灰烬；余烬 a small piece of ash or partly burnt coal, wood, etc. that is no longer burning but may still be hot</sub>; and also in waiting for the passing
    of trucks which travelled over a certain route and were
    known to carry cattle feed, and which, when they jolted<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">震动，摇动，颠簸 to move or to make sb/sth move suddenly and roughly</sub>
    over the bad patches in the road, sometimes spilt a few fragments of oil-cake.

<p class="indented">
    When his father disappeared, his mother did not show
    any surprise or any violent grief, but a sudden change came
    over her. She seemed to have become completely spiritless.
    It was evident even to Winston that she was waiting for
    something that she knew must happen. She did everything
    that was needed—cooked, washed, mended, made the bed,
    swept the floor, dusted the mantelpiece—always very slowly
    and with a curious lack of superfluous motion, like an artist’s
    lay-figure moving of its own accord. Her large shapely
    body seemed to relapse naturally into stillness. For hours
    at a time she would sit almost immobile on the bed, nursing
    his young sister, a tiny, ailing, very silent child of two
    or three, with a face made simian<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">像猿（或猴）的；猿（或猴）的like a monkey or an ape ; connected with monkeys or apes</sub> by thinness. Very occasionally
    she would take Winston in her arms and press him
    against her for a long time without saying anything. He was
    aware, in spite of his youthfulness and selfishness, that this
    was somehow connected with the never-mentioned thing
    that was about to happen.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    He remembered the room where they lived, a dark, close-smelling
    room that seemed half filled by a bed with a white
    counterpane<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">床单</sub>. There was a gas ring<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">煤气灶火圈 a round piece of metal with holes in it on the top of a gas cooker/stove, where the gas is lit to produce the flame for cooking</sub> in the fender<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">壁炉的栅栏 a frame around a fireplace to prevent burning coal or wood from falling out</sub>, and a shelf
    where food was kept, and on the landing outside there was
    a brown earthenware sink, common to several rooms. He
    remembered his mother’s statuesque<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">又高又美的；雕塑般的 tall and beautiful in an impressive way; like a statue</sub> body bending over the
    gas ring to stir at something in a saucepan. Above all he
    remembered his continuous hunger, and the fierce sordid<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">卑鄙的；丑恶的；无耻的immoral or dishonest</sub>
    battles at mealtimes. He would ask his mother naggingly<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">纠缠不休的；难以摆脱的continuing for a long time and difficult to cure or remove</sub>,
    over and over again, why there was not more food, he would
    shout and storm at her (he even remembered the tones of
    his voice, which was beginning to break prematurely and
    sometimes boomed in a peculiar way), or he would attempt
    a snivelling<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">哭哭啼啼的；爱哭诉的 tending to cry or complain a lot in a way that annoys people</sub> note of pathos<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">感染力；令人产生悲悯共鸣的力量 the power of a performance, description, etc. to produce feelings of sadness and sympathy</sub> in his efforts to get more than his
    share. His mother was quite ready to give him more than
    his share. She took it for granted that he, ‘the boy’, should
    have the biggest portion; but however much she gave him
    he invariably demanded more. At every meal she would beseech<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">恳求；哀求；乞求 to ask sb for sth in an anxious way because you want or need it very much</sub> him not to be selfish and to remember that his little
    sister was sick and also needed food, but it was no use. He
    would cry out with rage when she stopped ladling, he would
    try to wrench<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">猛拉；猛扭；猛拧 to pull or twist sth/sb/yourself suddenly and violently</sub> the saucepan and spoon out of her hands, he
    would grab bits from his sister’s plate. He knew that he was
    starving the other two, but he could not help it; he even felt
    that he had a right to do it. The clamorous<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">闹哄哄
    demanding attention loudly and insistently</sub> hunger in his belly
    seemed to justify him. Between meals, if his mother did
    not stand guard, he was constantly pilfering<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">偷窃（小东西）；小偷小摸；（尤指员工）偷窃to steal things of little value or in small quantities, especially from the place where you work</sub> at the wretched<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">可怜的；悲惨的 making you feel sympathy or pity</sub>
    store of food on the shelf.

</p>

<p class="indented">
    One day a chocolate-ration was issued. There had been
    no such issue for weeks or months past. He remembered
    quite clearly that precious little morsel<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">少量，一块（食物）a small amount or a piece of sth, especially food</sub> of chocolate. It was a
    two-ounce slab (they still talked about ounces in those days)
    between the three of them. It was obvious that it ought to
    be divided into three equal parts. Suddenly, as though he
    were listening to somebody else, Winston heard himself
    demanding in a loud booming voice that he should be given
    the whole piece. His mother told him not to be greedy.
    There was a long, nagging argument that went round and
    round, with shouts, whines, tears, remonstrances, bargainings.
    His tiny sister, clinging to her mother with both hands,
    exactly like a baby monkey, sat looking over her shoulder at
    him with large, mournful eyes. In the end his mother broke
    off three-quarters of the chocolate and gave it to Winston,
    giving the other quarter to his sister. The little girl took hold
    of it and looked at it dully, perhaps not knowing what it was.
    Winston stood watching her for a moment. Then with a
    sudden swift spring he had snatched the piece of chocolate
    out of his sister’s hand and was fleeing for the door.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Winston, Winston!’ his mother called after him. ‘Come
    back! Give your sister back her chocolate!’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    He stopped, but did not come back. His mother’s anxious
    eyes were fixed on his face. Even now he was thinking
    about the thing, he did not know what it was that was on
    the point of happening. His sister, conscious of having been
    robbed of something, had set up a feeble<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">虚弱的；衰弱的 very weak</sub> wail<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（因悲伤或疼痛）哭号，恸哭 to make a long loud high cry because you are sad or in pain</sub>. His mother
    drew her arm round the child and pressed its face against
    her breast. Something in the gesture told him that his sister
    was dying. He turned and fled down the stairs, with the
    chocolate growing sticky in his hand.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    He never saw his mother again. After he had devoured
    the chocolate he felt somewhat ashamed of himself and
    hung about in the streets for several hours, until hunger
    drove him home. When he came back his mother had disappeared.
    This was already becoming normal at that time.
    Nothing was gone from the room except his mother and his
    sister. They had not taken any clothes, not even his mother’s
    overcoat. To this day he did not know with any certainty
    that his mother was dead. It was perfectly possible that she
    had merely been sent to a forced-labour camp. As for his
    sister, she might have been removed, like Winston himself,
    to one of the colonies for homeless children (Reclamation
    Centres, they were called) which had grown up as a result
    of the civil war, or she might have been sent to the labour
    camp along with his mother, or simply left somewhere or
    other to die.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    The dream was still vivid in his mind, especially the
    enveloping protecting gesture of the arm in which its whole
    meaning seemed to be contained. His mind went back to
    another dream of two months ago. Exactly as his mother
    had sat on the dingy<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">又黑又脏的；昏暗的；肮脏的dark and dirty</sub> white quilted<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">絮棉的；加衬芯的 made of two layers of cloth with soft material between them, held in place by lines of stitches</sub> bed, with the child clinging
    to her, so she had sat in the sunken ship, far underneath
    him, and drowning deeper every minute, but still looking
    up at him through the darkening water.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    He told Julia the story of his mother’s disappearance.
    Without opening her eyes she rolled over and settled herself
    into a more comfortable position.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘I expect you were a beastly little swine in those days,’ she
    said indistinctly. ‘All children are swine.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Yes. But the real point of the story——’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    From her breathing it was evident that she was going
    off to sleep again. He would have liked to continue talking
    about his mother. He did not suppose, from what he could
    remember of her, that she had been an unusual woman, still
    less an intelligent one; and yet she had possessed a kind of
    nobility, a kind of purity, simply because the standards that
    she obeyed were private ones. Her feelings were her own,
    and could not be altered from outside. It would not have
    occurred to her that an action which is ineffectual thereby
    becomes meaningless. <strong>If you loved someone, you loved him,
    and when you had nothing else to give, you still gave him
    love.</strong> When the last of the chocolate was gone, his mother
    had clasped the child in her arms. It was no use, it changed
    nothing, it did not produce more chocolate, it did not avert
    the child’s death or her own; but it seemed natural to her to
    do it. The refugee woman in the boat had also covered the
    little boy with her arm, which was no more use against the
    bullets than a sheet of paper. The terrible thing that the Party
    had done was to persuade you that mere impulses, mere
    feelings, were of no account, while at the same time robbing
    you of all power over the material world. When once you
    were in the grip of the Party, what you felt or did not feel,
    what you did or refrained from doing, made literally no difference.
    Whatever happened you vanished, and neither you
    nor your actions were ever heard of again. You were lifted
    clean out of the stream of history. And yet to the people
    of only two generations ago this would not have seemed
    all-important, because they were not attempting to alter
    history. They were governed by private loyalties which they
    did not question. What mattered were individual relationships,
    and a completely helpless gesture, an embrace, a tear,
    a word spoken to a dying man, could have value in itself.
    The proles, it suddenly occurred to him, had remained in
    this condition. They were not loyal to a party or a country or
    an idea, they were loyal to one another. For the first time in
    his life he did not despise the proles or think of them merely
    as an inert force which would one day spring to life and regenerate
    the world. The proles had stayed human. They had
    not become hardened inside. They had held on to the primitive
    emotions which he himself had to re-learn by conscious
    effort. And in thinking this he remembered, without apparent
    relevance, how a few weeks ago he had seen a severed
    hand lying on the pavement and had kicked it into the gutter
    as though it had been a cabbage-stalk<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">结球甘蓝，一种蔬菜</sub>.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘The proles are human beings,’ he said aloud. ‘We are not human.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Why not?’ said Julia, who had woken up again.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    He thought for a little while. ‘Has it ever occurred to you,’
    he said, ‘that the best thing for us to do would be simply to
    walk out of here before it’s too late, and never see each other again?’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Yes, dear, it has occurred to me, several times. But I’m
    not going to do it, all the same.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘We’ve been lucky,’ he said ‘but it can’t last much longer.
    You’re young. You look normal and innocent. If you keep
    clear of people like me, you might stay alive for another fifty
    years.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘No. I’ve thought it all out. What you do, I’m going to do.
    And don’t be too downhearted<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">情绪低落；垂头丧气；悲哀 feeling depressed or sad</sub>. I’m rather good at staying alive.’
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘We may be together for another six months—a year—
    there’s no knowing. At the end we’re certain to be apart. Do
    you realize how utterly alone we shall be? When once they
    get hold of us there will be nothing, literally nothing, that
    either of us can do for the other. If I confess, they’ll shoot
    you, and if I refuse to confess, they’ll shoot you just the same.
    Nothing that I can do or say, or stop myself from saying, will
    put off your death for as much as five minutes. Neither of us
    will even know whether the other is alive or dead. We shall
    be utterly without power of any kind. <strong>The one thing that
    matters is that we shouldn’t betray one another, although
    even that can’t make the slightest difference.</strong>’
    <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：后面的结局，应该就是两个人的互相背叛。</sub>
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘If you mean confessing,’ she said, ‘we shall do that, right
    enough. Everybody always confesses. You can’t help it. They
    torture you.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘I don’t mean confessing. Confession is not betrayal.
    What you say or do doesn’t matter: only feelings matter. If
    they could make me stop loving you—that would be the
    real betrayal.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    She thought it over. ‘They can’t do that,’ she said finally.
    ‘It’s the one thing they can’t do. They can make you say
    anything—ANYTHING—but they can’t make you believe
    it. They can’t get inside you.’
    <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：或许这就是真正可怕的地方，它确实可以做到</sub>
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘No,’ he said a little more hopefully, ‘no; that’s quite true.
    They can’t get inside you. If you can FEEL that staying human
    is worth while, even when it can’t have any result
    whatever, you’ve beaten them.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    He thought of the telescreen with its never-sleeping ear.
    They could spy upon you night and day, but if you kept your
    head you could still outwit them. With all their cleverness
    they had never mastered the secret of finding out what another
    human being was thinking. Perhaps that was less true
    when you were actually in their hands. One did not know
    what happened inside the Ministry of Love, but it was possible
    to guess: tortures, drugs, delicate instruments that
    registered your nervous reactions, gradual wearing-down
    by sleeplessness and solitude and persistent questioning.
    Facts, at any rate, could not be kept hidden. They could be
    tracked down by enquiry, they could be squeezed out of you
    by torture. But if the object was not to stay alive but to stay
    human, what difference did it ultimately make? They could
    not alter your feelings: for that matter you could not alter
    them yourself, even if you wanted to. They could lay bare in
    the utmost detail everything that you had done or said or
    thought; but the inner heart, whose workings were mysterious
    even to yourself, remained impregnable<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">不可战胜的；难以改变的strong and impossible to defeat or change</sub>.
