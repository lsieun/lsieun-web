    ‘<i>If there is hope</i>,’ wrote Winston, ‘<i>it lies in the proles</i>.’
</p>

<p>
    If there was hope, it MUST lie in the proles, because
    only there in those swarming disregarded masses, 85 percent
    of the population of Oceania, could the force to destroy
    the Party ever be generated. The Party could not be
    overthrown from within. Its enemies, if it had any enemies,
    had no way of coming together or even of identifying one
    another. Even if the legendary Brotherhood existed, as just
    possibly it might, it was inconceivable that its members
    could ever assemble in larger numbers than twos and threes.
    Rebellion meant a look in the eyes, an inflexion<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">语调</sub> of the voice,
    at the most, an occasional whispered word. But the proles,
    if only they could somehow become conscious of their own
    strength. would have no need to conspire<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">密谋；图谋；阴谋to secretly plan with other people to do sth illegal or harmful</sub>. They needed only
    to rise up and shake themselves like a horse shaking off flies.
    If they chose they could blow the Party to pieces tomorrow
    morning. Surely sooner or later it must occur to them to do
    it? And yet——!

    He remembered how once he had been walking down
    a crowded street when a tremendous shout of hundreds of
    voices women’s voices—had burst from a side-street a little
    way ahead. It was a great formidable cry of anger and despair,
    a deep, loud ‘Oh-o-o-o-oh!’ that went humming on
    like the reverberation<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">回响；回声；反响a loud noise that continues for some time after it has been produced because of the surfaces around it</sub> of a bell. His heart had leapt. It’s started!
    he had thought. A riot! The proles are breaking loose<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">break loose 挣脱束缚</sub>
    at last! When he had reached the spot it was to see a mob<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">人群；（尤指）暴民a large crowd of people, especially one that may become violent or cause trouble</sub>
    of two or three hundred women crowding round the stalls<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">货摊，摊位，售货亭（尤指集市上的）a table or small shop with an open front that people sell things from, especially at a market</sub>
    of a street market, with faces as tragic as though they had
    been the doomed passengers on a sinking ship. But at this
    moment the general despair broke down into a multitude
    of individual quarrels. It appeared that one of the stalls
    had been selling tin<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">锡a chemical element. Tin is a soft silver-white metal that is often mixed with other metals or used to cover them to prevent them from rusting .</sub> saucepans<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（带盖，有一长柄或两耳的）深煮锅a deep round metal pot with a lid and one long handle or two short handles, used for cooking things over heat</sub>. They were wretched<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">极坏的；恶劣的extremely bad or unpleasant</sub>, flimsy<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">劣质的；不结实的badly made and not strong enough for the purpose for which it is used</sub>
    things, but cooking-pots of any kind were always difficult
    to get. Now the supply had unexpectedly given out. The
    successful women, bumped and jostled<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（在人群中）挤，推，撞，搡to push roughly against sb in a crowd</sub> by the rest, were
    trying to make off<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">逃走；逃跑；急忙离开</sub> with their saucepans while dozens of
    others clamoured<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（尤指乱哄哄地）大声地喊叫，呼叫to shout loudly, especially in a confused way</sub> round the stall, accusing the stall-keeper
    of favouritism<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">偏爱；偏袒the act of unfairly treating one person better than others because you like them better</sub> and of having more saucepans somewhere
    in reserve. There was a fresh outburst of yells. Two bloated<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">膨胀的；肿胀的；臃肿的full of liquid or gas and therefore bigger than normal, in a way that is unpleasant</sub>
    women, one of them with her hair coming down, had
    got hold of the same saucepan and were trying to tear it
    out of one another’s hands. For a moment they were both
    tugging<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（常为几次用力）拉，拖，拽to pull sth hard, often several times</sub>, and then the handle came off. Winston watched
    them disgustedly. And yet, just for a moment, what almost
    frightening power had sounded in that cry from only a few
    hundred throats! <strong>Why was it that they could never shout
    like that about anything that mattered?</strong>

    He wrote:
</p>

<p>
    <i>
        Until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until
        after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious.
    </i>
</p>

<p>
    That, he reflected, might almost have been a transcription<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">抄写；誊写 the act or process of representing sth in a written or printed form</sub>
    from one of the Party textbooks. The Party claimed, of
    course, to have liberated the proles from bondage. Before
    the Revolution they had been hideously oppressed by the
    capitalists, they had been starved and flogged<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">鞭笞，棒打（作为惩罚）to punish sb by hitting them many times with a whip or stick</sub>, women had
    been forced to work in the coal mines (women still did work
    in the coal mines, as a matter of fact), children had been
    sold into the factories at the age of six. But simultaneously,
    true to the Principles of doublethink, the Party taught
    that the proles were natural inferiors<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">不如别人的人；级别（或地位）低的人a person who is not as good as sb else; a person who is lower in rank or status</sub> who must be kept in
    subjection<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">臣服；隶属；屈从 the bringing of a person or people under the control of another, usually by force</sub>, like animals, by the application of a few simple
    rules. In reality very little was known about the proles. It
    was not necessary to know much. So long as they continued
    to work and breed, their other activities were without
    importance. Left to themselves, like cattle turned loose
    upon the plains of Argentina, they had reverted to a style of
    life that appeared to be natural to them, a sort of ancestral
    pattern. They were born, they grew up in the gutters<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">恶劣的社会环境；（社会最低阶层的）道德沦落the bad social conditions or low moral standards sometimes connected with the lowest level of society</sub>, they
    went to work at twelve, they passed through a brief blossoming-period
    of beauty and sexual desire, they married at
    twenty, they were middle-aged at thirty, they died, for the
    most part, at sixty. Heavy physical work, the care of home
    and children, petty quarrels with neighbours, films, football,
    beer, and above all, gambling, filled up the horizon<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（欲望、知识或兴趣的）范围，眼界the limit of your desires, knowledge or interests</sub>
    of their minds. To keep them in control was not difficult.
    A few agents of the Thought Police moved always among
    them, spreading false rumours and marking down and
    eliminating the few individuals who were judged capable of
    becoming dangerous; but no attempt was made to indoctrinate<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">强行灌输（信仰或学说）to force sb to accept a particular belief or set of beliefs and not allow them to consider any others</sub>
    them with the ideology of the Party. It was not desirable
    that the proles should have strong political feelings. <strong>All that
    was required of them was a primitive patriotism<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">爱国主义；爱国精神love of your country and willingness to defend it</sub> which
    could be appealed to whenever it was necessary to make
    them accept longer working-hours or shorter rations. And
    even when they became discontented, as they sometimes
    did, their discontent led nowhere, because being without
    general ideas, they could only focus it on petty specific
    grievances. The larger evils invariably escaped their notice.</strong>
    The great majority of proles did not even have telescreens in
    their homes. Even the civil police interfered with them very
    little. There was a vast amount of criminality<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">犯罪；有罪；犯罪行为the fact of people being involved in crime; criminal acts</sub> in London, a
    whole world-within-a-world of thieves, bandits<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">土匪a member of an armed group of thieves who attack travellers</sub>, prostitutes,
    drug-peddlers, and racketeers<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">诈骗者；非法获取钱财者a person who makes money through dishonest or illegal activities</sub> of every description; but
    since it all happened among the proles themselves, it was
    of no importance. In all questions of morals they were allowed
    to follow their ancestral code. The sexual puritanism<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">十分严格的道德观 very strict moral attitudes</sub>
    of the Party was not imposed upon them. Promiscuity<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">性乱行为</sub> went
    unpunished, divorce was permitted. For that matter, even
    religious worship would have been permitted if the proles
    had shown any sign of needing or wanting it. They were
    beneath suspicion. As the Party slogan put it: ‘Proles and
    animals are free.’

    Winston reached down and cautiously scratched his
    varicose ulcer. It had begun itching again. The thing you
    invariably came back to was the impossibility of knowing
    what life before the Revolution had really been like. He took
    out of the drawer a copy of a children’s history textbook
    which he had borrowed from Mrs Parsons, and began copying
    a passage into the diary:
</p>

<p>
    <i>
        In the old days (it ran), before the glorious Revolution,
        London was not the beautiful city that we know today. It
        was a dark, dirty, miserable place where hardly anybody
        had enough to eat and where hundreds and thousands of
        poor people had no boots on their feet and not even a roof to
        sleep under. Children no older than you had to work twelve
        hours a day for cruel masters who flogged them with whips
        if they worked too slowly and fed them on nothing but stale
        breadcrusts and water. But in among all this terrible poverty
        there were just a few great big beautiful houses that were
        lived in by rich men who had as many as thirty servants to
        look after them. These rich men were called capitalists. They
        were fat, ugly men with wicked faces, like the one in the
        picture on the opposite page. You can see that he is dressed in
        a long black coat which was called a frock coat, and a queer,
        shiny hat shaped like a stovepipe, which was called a top hat.
        This was the uniform of the capitalists, and no one else was
        allowed to wear it. The capitalists owned everything in the
        world, and everyone else was their slave. They owned all the
        land, all the houses, all the factories, and all the money. If
        anyone disobeyed them they could throw them into prison, or
        they could take his job away and starve him to death. When
        any ordinary person spoke to a capitalist he had to cringe<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">畏缩；怯退to move back and/or away from sb because you are afraid</sub> and
        bow to him, and take off his cap and address him as ‘Sir’. The
        chief of all the capitalists was called the King, and——
    </i>
</p>

<p>
    But he knew the rest of the catalogue. There would be
    mention of the bishops in their lawn sleeves, the judges in
    their ermine robes, the pillory, the stocks, the treadmill, the
    cat-o’-nine tails, the Lord Mayor’s Banquet, and the practice
    of kissing the Pope’s toe. There was also something
    called the JUS PRIMAE NOCTIS<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">初夜权</sub>, which would probably
    not be mentioned in a textbook for children. It was the law
    by which every capitalist had the right to sleep with any
    woman working in one of his factories.

    How could you tell how much of it was lies? It MIGHT
    be true that the average human being was better off now
    than he had been before the Revolution. <strong>The only evidence
    to the contrary was the mute protest in your own bones, the
    instinctive feeling that the conditions you lived in were intolerable
    and that at some other time they must have been
    different</strong>.<sub class="my_note" style="color:red">笔记：所有的“证据”都在表明“现在的你”要比“过去的你”过的好，但是在你的心中总是有一种挥之不去的“怀疑”，或称之为“无声的反抗”(mute protest)，因为你总是会觉得，一定会有其他形式的生活状态，不一定非要像现在的这个样子。</sub>
    It struck him that the truly characteristic thing
    about modern life was not its cruelty and insecurity, but
    simply its bareness<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">赤裸</sub>, its dinginess<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">暗淡;肮脏</sub>, its listlessness<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">精神萎靡</sub>. Life, if you
    looked about you, bore no resemblance not only to the lies
    that streamed out of the telescreens, but even to the ideals
    that the Party was trying to achieve. Great areas of it, even
    for a Party member, were neutral and non-political, a matter
    of slogging<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">埋头苦干；坚持不懈地做to work hard and steadily at sth, especially sth that takes a long time and is boring or difficult</sub> through dreary jobs, fighting for a place on
    the Tube, darning<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">织补；缝补to repair a hole in a piece of clothing by sewing stitches across the hole</sub> a worn-out sock, cadging<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">乞讨；乞得；索取to ask sb for food, money, etc. especially because you cannot or do not want to pay for sth yourself</sub> a saccharine<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">糖精</sub>
    tablet, saving a cigarette end. The ideal set up by the Party
    was something huge, terrible, and glittering—a world of
    steel and concrete, of monstrous machines and terrifying
    weapons—a nation of warriors and fanatics, marching forward
    in perfect unity, all thinking the same thoughts and
    shouting the same slogans, perpetually working, fighting,
    triumphing, persecuting—three hundred million people all
    with the same face. The reality was decaying, dingy<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">又黑又脏的；昏暗的；肮脏的dark and dirty</sub> cities
    where underfed people shuffled to and fro in leaky<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">有漏洞的；有漏隙的；渗漏的having holes or cracks that allow liquid or gas to escape</sub> shoes,
    in patched-up nineteenth-century houses that smelt always
    of cabbage and bad lavatories. He seemed to see a vision of
    London, vast and ruinous, city of a million dustbins, and
    mixed up with it was a picture of Mrs Parsons, a woman
    with lined<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">有皱纹的having folds or lines because of age, worry, etc.</sub> face and wispy<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">一绺绺的；一缕缕的；成束的；纤细的consisting of small, thin pieces; not thick</sub> hair, fiddling<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（尤指厌烦或紧张地）不断摸弄，不停摆弄to keep touching or moving sth with your hands, especially because you are bored or nervous</sub> helplessly with a
