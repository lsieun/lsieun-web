    ‘<i>If there is hope</i>,’ wrote Winston, ‘<i>it lies in the proles</i>.’
</p>

<p>
    If there was hope, it MUST lie in the proles, because
    only there in those swarming disregarded masses, 85 percent
    of the population of Oceania, could the force to destroy
    the Party ever be generated. The Party could not be
    overthrown from within. Its enemies, if it had any enemies,
    had no way of coming together or even of identifying one
    another. Even if the legendary Brotherhood existed, as just
    possibly it might, it was inconceivable that its members
    could ever assemble in larger numbers than twos and threes.
    Rebellion meant a look in the eyes, an inflexion<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">语调</sub> of the voice,
    at the most, an occasional whispered word. But the proles,
    if only they could somehow become conscious of their own
    strength. would have no need to conspire<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">密谋；图谋；阴谋to secretly plan with other people to do sth illegal or harmful</sub>. They needed only
    to rise up and shake themselves like a horse shaking off flies.
    If they chose they could blow the Party to pieces tomorrow
    morning. Surely sooner or later it must occur to them to do
    it? And yet——!

    He remembered how once he had been walking down
    a crowded street when a tremendous shout of hundreds of
    voices women’s voices—had burst from a side-street a little
    way ahead. It was a great formidable cry of anger and despair,
    a deep, loud ‘Oh-o-o-o-oh!’ that went humming on
    like the reverberation<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">回响；回声；反响a loud noise that continues for some time after it has been produced because of the surfaces around it</sub> of a bell. His heart had leapt. It’s started!
    he had thought. A riot! The proles are breaking loose<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">break loose 挣脱束缚</sub>
    at last! When he had reached the spot it was to see a mob<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">人群；（尤指）暴民a large crowd of people, especially one that may become violent or cause trouble</sub>
    of two or three hundred women crowding round the stalls<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">货摊，摊位，售货亭（尤指集市上的）a table or small shop with an open front that people sell things from, especially at a market</sub>
    of a street market, with faces as tragic as though they had
    been the doomed passengers on a sinking ship. But at this
    moment the general despair broke down into a multitude
    of individual quarrels. It appeared that one of the stalls
    had been selling tin<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">锡a chemical element. Tin is a soft silver-white metal that is often mixed with other metals or used to cover them to prevent them from rusting .</sub> saucepans<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（带盖，有一长柄或两耳的）深煮锅a deep round metal pot with a lid and one long handle or two short handles, used for cooking things over heat</sub>. They were wretched<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">极坏的；恶劣的extremely bad or unpleasant</sub>, flimsy<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">劣质的；不结实的badly made and not strong enough for the purpose for which it is used</sub>
    things, but cooking-pots of any kind were always difficult
    to get. Now the supply had unexpectedly given out. The
    successful women, bumped and jostled<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（在人群中）挤，推，撞，搡to push roughly against sb in a crowd</sub> by the rest, were
    trying to make off<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">逃走；逃跑；急忙离开</sub> with their saucepans while dozens of
    others clamoured<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（尤指乱哄哄地）大声地喊叫，呼叫to shout loudly, especially in a confused way</sub> round the stall, accusing the stall-keeper
    of favouritism<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">偏爱；偏袒the act of unfairly treating one person better than others because you like them better</sub> and of having more saucepans somewhere
    in reserve. There was a fresh outburst of yells. Two bloated<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">膨胀的；肿胀的；臃肿的full of liquid or gas and therefore bigger than normal, in a way that is unpleasant</sub>
    women, one of them with her hair coming down, had
    got hold of the same saucepan and were trying to tear it
    out of one another’s hands. For a moment they were both
    tugging<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（常为几次用力）拉，拖，拽to pull sth hard, often several times</sub>, and then the handle came off. Winston watched
    them disgustedly. And yet, just for a moment, what almost
    frightening power had sounded in that cry from only a few
    hundred throats! <strong>Why was it that they could never shout
    like that about anything that mattered?</strong>

    He wrote:
</p>

<p>
    <i>
        Until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until
        after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious.
    </i>
</p>

<p>
    That, he reflected, might almost have been a transcription<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">抄写；誊写 the act or process of representing sth in a written or printed form</sub>
    from one of the Party textbooks. The Party claimed, of
    course, to have liberated the proles from bondage. Before
    the Revolution they had been hideously oppressed by the
    capitalists, they had been starved and flogged<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">鞭笞，棒打（作为惩罚）to punish sb by hitting them many times with a whip or stick</sub>, women had
    been forced to work in the coal mines (women still did work
    in the coal mines, as a matter of fact), children had been
    sold into the factories at the age of six. But simultaneously,
    true to the Principles of doublethink, the Party taught
    that the proles were natural inferiors<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">不如别人的人；级别（或地位）低的人a person who is not as good as sb else; a person who is lower in rank or status</sub> who must be kept in
    subjection<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">臣服；隶属；屈从 the bringing of a person or people under the control of another, usually by force</sub>, like animals, by the application of a few simple
    rules. In reality very little was known about the proles. It
    was not necessary to know much. So long as they continued
    to work and breed, their other activities were without
    importance. Left to themselves, like cattle turned loose
    upon the plains of Argentina, they had reverted to a style of
    life that appeared to be natural to them, a sort of ancestral
    pattern. They were born, they grew up in the gutters<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">恶劣的社会环境；（社会最低阶层的）道德沦落the bad social conditions or low moral standards sometimes connected with the lowest level of society</sub>, they
    went to work at twelve, they passed through a brief blossoming-period
    of beauty and sexual desire, they married at
    twenty, they were middle-aged at thirty, they died, for the
    most part, at sixty. Heavy physical work, the care of home
    and children, petty quarrels with neighbours, films, football,
    beer, and above all, gambling, filled up the horizon<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（欲望、知识或兴趣的）范围，眼界the limit of your desires, knowledge or interests</sub>
    of their minds. To keep them in control was not difficult.
    A few agents of the Thought Police moved always among
    them, spreading false rumours and marking down and
    eliminating the few individuals who were judged capable of
    becoming dangerous; but no attempt was made to indoctrinate<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">强行灌输（信仰或学说）to force sb to accept a particular belief or set of beliefs and not allow them to consider any others</sub>
    them with the ideology of the Party. It was not desirable
    that the proles should have strong political feelings. <strong>All that
    was required of them was a primitive patriotism<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">爱国主义；爱国精神love of your country and willingness to defend it</sub> which
    could be appealed to whenever it was necessary to make
    them accept longer working-hours or shorter rations. And
    even when they became discontented, as they sometimes
    did, their discontent led nowhere, because being without
    general ideas, they could only focus it on petty specific
    grievances. The larger evils invariably escaped their notice.</strong>
    The great majority of proles did not even have telescreens in
    their homes. Even the civil police interfered with them very
    little. There was a vast amount of criminality<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">犯罪；有罪；犯罪行为the fact of people being involved in crime; criminal acts</sub> in London, a
    whole world-within-a-world of thieves, bandits<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">土匪a member of an armed group of thieves who attack travellers</sub>, prostitutes,
    drug-peddlers, and racketeers<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">诈骗者；非法获取钱财者a person who makes money through dishonest or illegal activities</sub> of every description; but
    since it all happened among the proles themselves, it was
    of no importance. In all questions of morals they were allowed
    to follow their ancestral code. The sexual puritanism<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">十分严格的道德观 very strict moral attitudes</sub>
    of the Party was not imposed upon them. Promiscuity<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">性乱行为</sub> went
    unpunished, divorce was permitted. For that matter, even
    religious worship would have been permitted if the proles
    had shown any sign of needing or wanting it. They were
    beneath suspicion. As the Party slogan put it: ‘Proles and
    animals are free.’

    Winston reached down and cautiously scratched his
    varicose ulcer. It had begun itching again. The thing you
    invariably came back to was the impossibility of knowing
    what life before the Revolution had really been like. He took
    out of the drawer a copy of a children’s history textbook
    which he had borrowed from Mrs Parsons, and began copying
    a passage into the diary:
</p>

<p>
    <i>
        In the old days (it ran), before the glorious Revolution,
        London was not the beautiful city that we know today. It
        was a dark, dirty, miserable place where hardly anybody
        had enough to eat and where hundreds and thousands of
        poor people had no boots on their feet and not even a roof to
        sleep under. Children no older than you had to work twelve
        hours a day for cruel masters who flogged them with whips
        if they worked too slowly and fed them on nothing but stale
        breadcrusts and water. But in among all this terrible poverty
        there were just a few great big beautiful houses that were
        lived in by rich men who had as many as thirty servants to
        look after them. These rich men were called capitalists. They
        were fat, ugly men with wicked faces, like the one in the
        picture on the opposite page. You can see that he is dressed in
        a long black coat which was called a frock coat, and a queer,
        shiny hat shaped like a stovepipe, which was called a top hat.
        This was the uniform of the capitalists, and no one else was
        allowed to wear it. The capitalists owned everything in the
        world, and everyone else was their slave. They owned all the
        land, all the houses, all the factories, and all the money. If
        anyone disobeyed them they could throw them into prison, or
        they could take his job away and starve him to death. When
        any ordinary person spoke to a capitalist he had to cringe<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">畏缩；怯退to move back and/or away from sb because you are afraid</sub> and
        bow to him, and take off his cap and address him as ‘Sir’. The
        chief of all the capitalists was called the King, and——
    </i>
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    But he knew the rest of the catalogue. There would be
    mention of the bishops in their lawn sleeves, the judges in
    their ermine robes, the pillory, the stocks, the treadmill, the
    cat-o’-nine tails, the Lord Mayor’s Banquet, and the practice
    of kissing the Pope’s toe. There was also something
    called the JUS PRIMAE NOCTIS<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">初夜权</sub>, which would probably
    not be mentioned in a textbook for children. It was the law
    by which every capitalist had the right to sleep with any
    woman working in one of his factories.

</p>

<p>
    How could you tell how much of it was lies? It MIGHT
    be true that the average human being was better off now
    than he had been before the Revolution. <strong>The only evidence
    to the contrary was the mute protest in your own bones, the
    instinctive feeling that the conditions you lived in were intolerable
    and that at some other time they must have been
    different</strong>.<sub class="my_note" style="color:red">笔记：所有的“证据”都在表明“现在的你”要比“过去的你”过的好，但是在你的心中总是有一种挥之不去的“怀疑”，或称之为“无声的反抗”(mute protest)，因为你总是会觉得，一定会有其他形式的生活状态，不一定非要像现在的这个样子。</sub>
    It struck him that the truly characteristic thing
    about modern life was not its cruelty and insecurity, but
    simply its bareness<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">赤裸</sub>, its dinginess<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">暗淡;肮脏</sub>, its listlessness<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">精神萎靡</sub>. Life, if you
    looked about you, bore no resemblance not only to the lies
    that streamed out of the telescreens, but even to the ideals
    that the Party was trying to achieve. Great areas of it, even
    for a Party member, were neutral and non-political, a matter
    of slogging<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">埋头苦干；坚持不懈地做to work hard and steadily at sth, especially sth that takes a long time and is boring or difficult</sub> through dreary jobs, fighting for a place on
    the Tube, darning<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">织补；缝补to repair a hole in a piece of clothing by sewing stitches across the hole</sub> a worn-out sock, cadging<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">乞讨；乞得；索取to ask sb for food, money, etc. especially because you cannot or do not want to pay for sth yourself</sub> a saccharine<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">糖精</sub>
    tablet, saving a cigarette end. The ideal set up by the Party
    was something huge, terrible, and glittering—a world of
    steel and concrete, of monstrous machines and terrifying
    weapons—a nation of warriors and fanatics, marching forward
    in perfect unity, all thinking the same thoughts and
    shouting the same slogans, perpetually working, fighting,
    triumphing, persecuting—three hundred million people all
    with the same face. The reality was decaying, dingy<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">又黑又脏的；昏暗的；肮脏的dark and dirty</sub> cities
    where underfed people shuffled to and fro in leaky<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">有漏洞的；有漏隙的；渗漏的having holes or cracks that allow liquid or gas to escape</sub> shoes,
    in patched-up nineteenth-century houses that smelt always
    of cabbage and bad lavatories. He seemed to see a vision of
    London, vast and ruinous, city of a million dustbins, and
    mixed up with it was a picture of Mrs Parsons, a woman
    with lined<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">有皱纹的having folds or lines because of age, worry, etc.</sub> face and wispy<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">一绺绺的；一缕缕的；成束的；纤细的consisting of small, thin pieces; not thick</sub> hair, fiddling<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（尤指厌烦或紧张地）不断摸弄，不停摆弄to keep touching or moving sth with your hands, especially because you are bored or nervous</sub> helplessly with a
    blocked waste-pipe.

<p>
    He reached down and scratched his ankle again. Day
    and night the telescreens bruised<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">打击；挫伤 to affect sb badly and make them feel unhappy and less confident</sub> your ears with statistics
    proving that people today had more food, more clothes,
    better houses, better recreations—that they lived longer,
    worked shorter hours, were bigger, healthier, stronger, happier,
    more intelligent, better educated, than the people of
    fifty years ago. Not a word of it could ever be proved or disproved.
    The Party claimed, for example, that today 40 per cent
    of adult proles were literate: before the Revolution, it
    was said, the number had only been 15 per cent. The Party
    claimed that the infant mortality<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">死亡数量；死亡率the number of deaths in a particular situation or period of time</sub> rate was now only 160 per
    thousand, whereas before the Revolution it had been 300—
    and so it went on. It was like a single equation with two
    unknowns. It might very well be that literally every word in
    the history books, even the things that one accepted without
    question, was pure fantasy<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">想象产物；幻想作品a product of your imagination</sub>. For all he knew there might
    never have been any such law as the JUS PRIMAE NOCTIS,
    or any such creature as a capitalist, or any such garment as
    a top hat.

<p>
    <strong>Everything faded into mist. The past was erased, the erasure
    was forgotten, the lie became truth.</strong> Just once in his
    life he had possessed—AFTER the event: that was what
    counted—concrete, unmistakable evidence of an act of falsification<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">弄虚作假;伪造;窜改;歪曲</sub>.
    He had held it between his fingers for as long as
    thirty seconds. In 1973, it must have been—at any rate, it
    was at about the time when he and Katharine had parted.
    But the really relevant date was seven or eight years earlier.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    The story really began in the middle sixties, the period of
    the great purges in which the original leaders of the Revolution
    were wiped out once and for all. By 1970 none of them
    was left, except Big Brother himself. All the rest had by that
    time been exposed as traitors and counter-revolutionaries.
    Goldstein had fled and was hiding no one knew where,
    and of the others, a few had simply disappeared, while the
    majority had been executed after spectacular<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">令人惊叹的very impressive</sub> public trials
    at which they made confession of their crimes. Among the
    last survivors were three men named Jones, Aaronson, and
    Rutherford. It must have been in 1965 that these three had
    been arrested. As often happened, they had vanished for a
    year or more, so that one did not know whether they were
    alive or dead, and then had suddenly been brought forth
    to incriminate<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">使负罪；连累to make it seem as if sb has done sth wrong or illegal</sub> themselves in the usual way. They had confessed
    to intelligence<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（尤指关于敌国的）情报 secret information that is collected, for example about a foreign country, especially one that is an enemy;</sub> with the enemy (at that date, too, the
    enemy was Eurasia), embezzlement<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">贪污；侵吞公款</sub> of public funds, the
    murder of various trusted Party members, intrigues<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">秘密策划（加害他人）；密谋to secretly plan with other people to harm sb</sub> against
    the leadership of Big Brother which had started long before
    the Revolution happened, and acts of sabotage<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">故意妨碍；捣乱；刻意阻碍the act of deliberately spoiling sth in order to prevent it from being successful</sub> causing the
    death of hundreds of thousands of people. After confessing
    to these things they had been pardoned, reinstated<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">使恢复原职；使重返岗位to give back a job or position that had been taken away from sb</sub> in
    the Party, and given posts which were in fact sinecures<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">闲职；挂名职位a job that you are paid for even though it involves little or no work</sub> but
    which sounded important. All three had written long, abject<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">下贱的；卑躬屈节的；自卑的without any pride or respect for yourself</sub>
    articles in ‘The Times’, analysing the reasons for their
    defection<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">叛党。这点需要注意，defect是“缺点；毛病”，而defection则有多个意思，其中一个意思就是“叛党”，结合现在的语境而选定了这个意思。</sub> and promising to make amends.

    Some time after their release Winston had actually seen
    all three of them in the Chestnut Tree Cafe. He remembered
    the sort of terrified fascination with which he had watched
    them out of the corner of his eye. They were men far older
    than himself, relics of the ancient world, almost the last
    great figures left over from the heroic days of the Party. The
    glamour of the underground struggle and the civil war still
    faintly clung to them. He had the feeling, though already at
    that time facts and dates were growing blurry<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">模糊不清的without a clear outline; not clear</sub>, that he had
    known their names years earlier than he had known that of
    Big Brother. But also they were outlaws<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（尤指过去的人）亡命徒，逃犯，草莽英雄，被剥夺法律权益者(used especially about people in the past) a person who has done sth illegal and is hiding to avoid being caught; a person who is not protected by the law</sub>, enemies, untouchables,
    doomed with absolute certainty to extinction within
    a year or two. No one who had once fallen into the hands
    of the Thought Police ever escaped in the end. They were
    corpses<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">尸体 the body of a dead person</sub> waiting to be sent back to the grave.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    There was no one at any of the tables nearest to them. It
    was not wise even to be seen in the neighbourhood of such
    people. They were sitting in silence before glasses of the gin
    flavoured with cloves<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">丁香粉</sub> which was the speciality of the cafe.
    Of the three, it was Rutherford whose appearance had most
    impressed Winston. Rutherford had once been a famous
    caricaturist<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">讽刺漫画家；讽刺画家</sub>, whose brutal cartoons had helped to inflame<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">使（局势）恶化；使更棘手to make a situation worse or more difficult to deal with</sub>
    popular opinion before and during the Revolution. Even
    now, at long intervals, his cartoons were appearing in The
    Times. They were simply an imitation of his earlier manner,
    and curiously lifeless and unconvincing. Always they were
    a rehashing<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（稍微改动）重新推出；以新形式表达旧内容to arrange ideas, pieces of writing or pieces of film into a new form but without any great change or improvement</sub> of the ancient themes—slum<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">贫民窟；棚屋区an area of a city that is very poor and where the houses are dirty and in bad condition</sub> tenements<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（尤指城市贫困区的）经济公寓，廉租公寓a large building divided into flats/apartments, especially in a poor area of a city</sub>, starving children, street battles, capitalists in top hats—even on
    the barricades the capitalists still seemed to cling to their
    top hats an endless, hopeless effort to get back into the past.
    He was a monstrous man, with a mane<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">长发；浓密的头发a person's long or thick hair</sub> of greasy<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">油性的；多脂的producing too much natural oil</sub> grey hair,
    his face pouched<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">悬垂如袋的</sub> and seamed<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">布满皱纹的covered with deep lines</sub>, with thick negroid<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">黑人(似)的</sub> lips. At
    one time he must have been immensely strong; now his
    great body was sagging<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">减弱；减少to become weaker or fewer</sub>, sloping, bulging<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">凸出；鼓胀to stick out from sth in a round shape</sub>, falling away in
    every direction. He seemed to be breaking up before one’s
    eyes, like a mountain crumbling<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">坍塌；损坏；崩裂if a building or piece of land is crumbling , parts of it are breaking off</sub>.

<p>
    It was the lonely hour of fifteen. Winston could not
    now remember how he had come to be in the cafe at such
    a time. The place was almost empty. A tinny music was
    trickling from the telescreens. The three men sat in their
    corner almost motionless, never speaking. Uncommanded,
    the waiter brought fresh glasses of gin. There was a chessboard
    on the table beside them, with the pieces set out but
    no game started. And then, for perhaps half a minute in all,
    something happened to the telescreens. The tune that they
    were playing changed, and the tone of the music changed
    too. There came into it—but it was something hard to describe.
    It was a peculiar, cracked, braying, jeering note: in
    his mind Winston called it a yellow note. And then a voice
    from the telescreen was singing:
</p>

<p>
    <pre>
        Under the spreading chestnut tree
        I sold you and you sold me:
        There lie they, and here lie we
        Under the spreading chestnut tree.
    </pre>
</p>

<p>
    The three men never stirred. But when Winston glanced
    again at Rutherford’s ruinous face, he saw that his eyes
    were full of tears. And for the first time he noticed, with a
    kind of inward shudder<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（因寒冷、害怕或激动而）发抖，打颤，战栗to shake because you are cold or frightened, or because of a strong feeling</sub>, and yet not knowing AT WHAT
    he shuddered, that both Aaronson and Rutherford had broken noses.

    A little later all three were re-arrested. It appeared that
    they had engaged in fresh conspiracies from the very moment
    of their release. At their second trial they confessed to
    all their old crimes over again, with a whole string of new
    ones. They were executed, and their fate was recorded in
    the Party histories, a warning to posterity. About five years
    after this, in 1973, Winston was unrolling a wad<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（纸张、钞票等的）卷，沓，捆a thick pile of pieces of paper, paper money, etc. folded or rolled together</sub> of documents
    which had just flopped<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（沉重、笨拙或不由自主地）落下，移动，悬挂to fall, move or hang in a heavy or awkward way, without control</sub> out of the pneumatic<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">充气的filled with air</sub> tube on
    to his desk when he came on a fragment of paper which
    had evidently been slipped in among the others and then
    forgotten. The instant he had flattened it out he saw its significance.
    It was a half-page torn out of ‘The Times’ of about
    ten years earlier—the top half of the page, so that it included
    the date—and it contained a photograph of the delegates at
    some Party function in New York. Prominent in the middle
    of the group were Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford. There
    was no mistaking them, in any case their names were in the
    caption at the bottom.

</p>

<p>
    The point was that at both trials all three men had confessed
    that on that date they had been on Eurasian soil. They
    had flown from a secret airfield in Canada to a rendezvous<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">约会地点a place where people have arranged to meet</sub>
    somewhere in Siberia, and had conferred with members of
    the Eurasian General Staff, to whom they had betrayed important
    military secrets. The date had stuck in Winston’s
    memory because it chanced to be midsummer day; but the
    whole story must be on record in countless other places as
    well. There was only one possible conclusion: the confessions were lies.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    Of course, this was not in itself a discovery. Even at that
    time Winston had not imagined that the people who were
    wiped out in the purges had actually committed the crimes
    that they were accused of. But this was concrete evidence;
    it was a fragment of the abolished past, like a fossil bone
    which turns up in the wrong stratum and destroys a geological
    theory. It was enough to blow the Party to atoms, if
    in some way it could have been published to the world and
    its significance made known.
</p>

<p>
    He had gone straight on working. As soon as he saw what
    the photograph was, and what it meant, he had covered it
    up with another sheet of paper. Luckily, when he unrolled
    it, it had been upside-down from the point of view of the
    telescreen.
</p>

<p>
    He took his scribbling pad on his knee and pushed back
    his chair so as to get as far away from the telescreen as possible.
    To keep your face expressionless was not difficult, and
    even your breathing could be controlled, with an effort:
    but you could not control the beating of your heart, and
    the telescreen was quite delicate enough to pick it up. He
    let what he judged to be ten minutes go by, tormented all
    the while by the fear that some accident—a sudden draught
    blowing across his desk, for instance—would betray him.
    Then, without uncovering it again, he dropped the photograph
    into the memory hole, along with some other waste
    papers. Within another minute, perhaps, it would have
    crumbled into ashes.
</p>

<p>
    That was ten—eleven years ago. Today, probably, he
    would have kept that photograph. It was curious that the
    fact of having held it in his fingers seemed to him to make
    a difference even now, when the photograph itself, as well
    as the event it recorded, was only memory. Was the Party’s
    hold upon the past less strong, he wondered, because a piece
    of evidence which existed no longer HAD ONCE existed?
</p>

<p>
    But today, supposing that it could be somehow resurrected<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">起死回生；使复活to bring a dead person back to life</sub>
    from its ashes, the photograph might not even be
    evidence. Already, at the time when he made his discovery,
    Oceania was no longer at war with Eurasia, and it must
    have been to the agents of Eastasia that the three dead men
    had betrayed their country. Since then there had been other
    changes—two, three, he could not remember how many.
    Very likely the confessions had been rewritten and rewritten
    until the original facts and dates no longer had the smallest
    significance. <strong>The past not only changed, but changed
    continuously.</strong> What most afflicted<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">折磨；使痛苦 to affect sb/sth in an unpleasant or harmful way</sub> him with the sense of
    nightmare was that he had never clearly understood why
    the huge imposture<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">冒名行骗 an act of tricking people deliberately by pretending to be sb else</sub> was undertaken. The immediate advantages
    of falsifying the past were obvious, but the ultimate
    motive was mysterious. He took up his pen again and
    wrote:

    He wondered, as he had many times wondered before,
    whether he himself was a lunatic<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">精神错乱者；狂人 a person who does crazy things that are often dangerous</sub>. Perhaps a lunatic was
    simply a minority<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">少数；少数派；少数人the smaller part of a group; less than half of the people or things in a large group</sub> of one. At one time it had been a sign of
    madness to believe that the earth goes round the sun; today,
    to believe that the past is inalterable. He might be ALONE
    in holding that belief, and if alone, then a lunatic. But the
    thought of being a lunatic did not greatly trouble him: the
    horror was that he might also be wrong.

<p>
    He picked up the children’s history book and looked at
    the portrait of Big Brother which formed its frontispiece<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（与书名页相对一页上的）卷首插图 a picture at the beginning of a book, on the page opposite the page with the title on it</sub>.
    The hypnotic<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">有催眠作用的；使人昏昏欲睡的making you feel as if you are going to fall asleep, especially because of a regular, repeated noise or movement</sub> eyes gazed into his own. It was as though
    some huge force were pressing down upon you—something
    that penetrated inside your skull, battering<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">连续猛击；殴打to hit sb/sth hard many times, especially in a way that causes serious damage</sub> against your
    brain, frightening you out of your beliefs, persuading you,
    almost, to deny the evidence of your senses. In the end the
    Party would announce that two and two made five, and you
    would have to believe it. It was inevitable that they should
    make that claim sooner or later: the logic of their position
    demanded it. Not merely the validity of experience, but the
    very existence of external reality, was tacitly<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">心照不宣地；默认</sub> denied by their
    philosophy. <strong>The heresy of heresies was common sense.</strong> And
    what was terrifying was not that they would kill you for
    thinking otherwise, but that they might be right. For, after
    all, how do we know that two and two make four? Or that
    the force of gravity works? Or that the past is unchangeable?
    If both the past and the external world exist only in
    the mind, and if the mind itself is controllable what then?

<p>
    But no! His courage seemed suddenly to stiffen<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（尤指因气愤或害怕，使浑身或身体的一部分）变僵硬，变僵直，绷紧to make yourself or part of your body firm, straight and still, especially because you are angry or frightened</sub> of its
    own accord<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">主动地 without being asked, forced or helped</sub>. The face of O’Brien, not called up by any obvious
    association, had floated into his mind. He knew, with
    more certainty than before, that O’Brien was on his side.
    He was writing the diary for O’Brien—TO O’Brien: it was
    like an interminable<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">冗长的；没完没了的lasting a very long time and therefore boring or annoying</sub> letter which no one would ever read,
    but which was addressed to a particular person and took its
    colour from that fact.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and
    ears. It was their final, most essential command. His heart
    sank as he thought of the enormous power arrayed<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">配置（兵力）to arrange soldiers in a position from which they are ready to attack</sub> against
    him, the ease with which any Party intellectual would overthrow
    him in debate, the subtle arguments which he would
    not be able to understand, much less answer. And yet he
    was in the right! They were wrong and he was right. The
    obvious, the silly, and the true had got to be defended. Truisms
    are true, hold on to that! The solid world exists, its laws
    do not change. Stones are hard, water is wet, objects unsupported
    fall towards the earth’s centre. With the feeling that
    he was speaking to O’Brien, and also that he was setting
    forth an important axiom<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">公理 a rule or principle that most people believe to be true</sub>, he wrote:
