    Winston was gelatinous<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">凝胶状的 thick and sticky, like a jelly</sub> with fatigue. Gelatinous was
    the right word. It had come into his head spontaneously.
    His body seemed to have not only the weakness of a
    jelly, but its translucency. He felt that if he held up his hand
    he would be able to see the light through it. All the blood
    and lymph<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">淋巴 a clear liquid containing white blood cells that helps to clean the tissues of the body and helps to prevent infections from spreading</sub> had been drained out of him by an enormous
    debauch of work, leaving only a frail structure of nerves,
    bones, and skin. All sensations seemed to be magnified. His
    overalls fretted his shoulders, the pavement tickled his feet,
    even the opening and closing of a hand was an effort that
    made his joints creak<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">嘎吱作响（开门或踩上木地板等时发出的声音）to make the sound that a door sometimes makes when you open it or that a wooden floor sometimes makes when you step on it</sub>.

    He had worked more than ninety hours in five days. So
    had everyone else in the Ministry. Now it was all over, and
    he had literally nothing to do, no Party work of any description,
    until tomorrow morning. He could spend six hours in
    the hiding-place and another nine in his own bed. Slowly, in
    mild afternoon sunshine, he walked up a dingy street in the
    direction of Mr Charrington’s shop, keeping one eye open
    for the patrols, but irrationally convinced that this afternoon
    there was no danger of anyone interfering with him.
    The heavy brief-case that he was carrying bumped against
    his knee at each step, sending a tingling sensation up and
    down the skin of his leg. Inside it was the book, which he
    had now had in his possession for six days and had not yet
    opened, nor even looked at.

    On the sixth day of Hate Week, after the processions, the
    speeches, the shouting, the singing, the banners, the posters,
    the films, the waxworks, the rolling of drums and squealing
    of trumpets, the tramp of marching feet, the grinding
    of the caterpillars of tanks, the roar of massed planes, the
    booming of guns—after six days of this, when the great orgasm
    was quivering to its climax and the general hatred of
    Eurasia had boiled up into such delirium that if the crowd
    could have got their hands on the 2,000 Eurasian war-criminals
    who were to be publicly hanged on the last day of the
    proceedings, they would unquestionably have torn them
    to pieces—at just this moment it had been announced that
    Oceania was not after all at war with Eurasia. Oceania was
    at war with Eastasia. Eurasia was an ally.

    There was, of course, no admission<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（尤指对过错、罪行的）承认，招认，招供a statement in which sb admits that sth is true, especially sth wrong or bad that they have done</sub> that any change had
    taken place. Merely it became known, with extreme suddenness
    and everywhere at once, that Eastasia and not
    Eurasia was the enemy. Winston was taking part in a demonstration
    in one of the central London squares at the
    moment when it happened. It was night, and the white faces
    and the scarlet banners were luridly<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">绚丽地；色彩斑斓地</sub> floodlit<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">泛光灯，泛光照明灯（运动场、舞台和建筑物外墙等用）a large powerful lamp, used for lighting sports grounds, theatre stages and the outside of buildings</sub>. The square
    was packed<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">塞进；挤进to fill sth with a lot of people or things</sub> with several thousand people, including a block
    of about a thousand schoolchildren in the uniform of the
    Spies. On a scarlet-draped platform an orator<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">讲演者；雄辩家；善于演说的人a person who makes formal speeches in public or is good at public speaking</sub> of the Inner
    Party, a small lean man with disproportionately long arms
    and a large bald skull over which a few lank locks straggled,
    was haranguing<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">呵斥；大声谴责；慷慨激昂地劝说to speak loudly and angrily in a way that criticizes sb/sth or tries to persuade people to do sth</sub> the crowd. A little Rumpelstiltskin<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">侏儒怪</sub>
    figure, contorted with hatred, he gripped the neck of the
    microphone with one hand while the other, enormous at
    the end of a bony<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">瘦骨嶙峋的very thin so that the bones can be seen under the skin</sub> arm, clawed the air menacingly<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">险恶；威胁地</sub> above his
    head. His voice, made metallic<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">金属般的；有金属味（或声音）的that looks, tastes or sounds like metal</sub> by the amplifiers<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">放大器；扩音器；扬声器 an electrical device or piece of equipment that makes sounds or radio signals louder</sub>, boomed<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">以低沉有力的声音说话to say sth in a loud deep voice</sub>
    forth an endless catalogue of atrocities<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（尤指战争中的）残暴行为a cruel and violent act, especially in a war</sub>, massacres, deportations<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">驱逐出境</sub>,
    lootings<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">掠夺；洗劫</sub>, rapings, torture of prisoners, bombing
    of civilians, lying propaganda, unjust aggressions, broken
    treaties. It was almost impossible to listen to him without
    being first convinced and then maddened. At every few moments
    the fury<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">狂怒；暴怒a state of being extremely angry about sth</sub> of the crowd boiled over and the voice of the
    speaker was drowned by a wild beast-like roaring that rose
    uncontrollably from thousands of throats. <strong>The most savage
    yells of all came from the schoolchildren.</strong> The speech
    had been proceeding for perhaps twenty minutes when a
    messenger hurried on to the platform and a scrap of paper
    was slipped into the speaker’s hand. He unrolled and read it
    without pausing in his speech. Nothing altered in his voice
    or manner, or in the content of what he was saying, but suddenly
    the names were different. Without words said, a wave
    of understanding rippled through the crowd. Oceania was
    at war with Eastasia! The next moment there was a tremendous
    commotion. The banners and posters with which the
    square was decorated were all wrong! Quite half of them
    had the wrong faces on them. It was sabotage<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（为防止敌人利用或表示抗议而对设备、交通等进行的）蓄意毁坏，人为破坏the act of doing deliberate damage to equipment, transport, machines, etc. to prevent an enemy from using them, or to protest about sth</sub>! The agents of
    Goldstein had been at work! There was a riotous interlude
    while posters were ripped from the walls, banners torn to
    shreds<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（撕或切的）细条</sub> and trampled underfoot. The Spies performed prodigies<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（年轻的）天才，奇才，精英；神童a young person who is unusually intelligent or skillful for their age</sub>
    of activity in clambering<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（吃力地）攀登，攀爬to climb or move with difficulty or a lot of effort, using your hands and feet</sub> over the rooftops and cutting
    the streamers<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">条幅；横幅a long narrow piece of cloth or other material</sub> that fluttered from the chimneys. But within
    two or three minutes it was all over. The orator, still gripping
    the neck of the microphone, his shoulders hunched<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">弓身；弓背；耸肩to bend the top part of your body forward and raise your shoulders and back</sub> forward,
    his free hand clawing at the air, had gone straight on with
    his speech. One minute more, and the feral<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">凶猛的</sub> roars of rage
    were again bursting from the crowd. The Hate continued
    exactly as before, except that the target had been changed.

    The thing that impressed Winston in looking back was
    that the speaker had switched from one line to the other actually
    in midsentence, not only without a pause, but without
    even breaking the syntax. But at the moment he had other
    things to preoccupy him. It was during the moment of disorder
    while the posters were being torn down that a man
    whose face he did not see had tapped him on the shoulder
    and said, ‘Excuse me, I think you’ve dropped your briefcase.’
    He took the brief-case abstractedly<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">心不在焉地</sub>, without speaking.
    He knew that it would be days before he had an opportunity
    to look inside it. The instant that the demonstration was
    over he went straight to the Ministry of Truth, though the
    time was now nearly twenty-three hours. The entire staff
    of the Ministry had done likewise. The orders already issuing
    from the telescreen, recalling them to their posts, were
    hardly necessary.

    Oceania was at war with Eastasia: Oceania had always
    been at war with Eastasia. A large part of the political literature
    of five years was now completely obsolete. Reports
    and records of all kinds, newspapers, books, pamphlets,
    films, sound-tracks, photographs—all had to be rectified
    at lightning speed. Although no directive was ever issued,
    it was known that the chiefs of the Department intended
    that within one week no reference to the war with Eurasia,
    or the alliance with Eastasia, should remain in existence
    anywhere. The work was overwhelming, all the more so
    because the processes that it involved could not be called
    by their true names. Everyone in the Records Department
    worked eighteen hours in the twenty-four, with two three-hour
    snatches of sleep. Mattresses<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">床垫the soft part of a bed, that you lie on</sub> were brought up from
    the cellars and pitched all over the corridors: meals consisted
    of sandwiches and Victory Coffee wheeled round
    on trolleys<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">手推车；手拉车 a small vehicle with wheels that can be pushed or pulled along and is used for carrying things</sub> by attendants from the canteen. Each time that
    Winston broke off for one of his spells of sleep he tried to
    leave his desk clear of work, and each time that he crawled
    back sticky-eyed and aching, it was to find that another
    shower<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">一大批；一阵；一连串 a large number of things that arrive or fall together</sub> of paper cylinders had covered the desk like a snowdrift<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（风吹成的）雪堆 a deep pile of snow that has been blown together by the wind</sub>,
    halfburying the speakwrite and overflowing on to the
    floor, so that the first job was always to stack them into a
    neat enough pile to give him room to work. What was worst
    of all was that the work was by no means purely mechanical.
    Often it was enough merely to substitute one name for another,
    but any detailed report of events demanded care and
    imagination. Even the geographical knowledge that one
    needed in transferring the war from one part of the world
    to another was considerable<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">相当多（或大、重要等）的great in amount, size, importance, etc.</sub>.

    By the third day his eyes ached unbearably and his
    spectacles needed wiping every few minutes. It was like
    struggling with some crushing<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（强调糟糕或严重的程度）惨重的，毁坏性的 used to emphasize how bad or severe sth is</sub> physical task, something
    which one had the right to refuse and which one was nevertheless
    neurotically<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">神经质地；神经过敏地</sub> anxious to accomplish. In so far as he
    had time to remember it, he was not troubled by the fact that
    every word he murmured into the speakwrite, every stroke
    of his ink-pencil, was a deliberate lie. He was as anxious as
    anyone else in the Department that the forgery should be
    perfect. On the morning of the sixth day the dribble<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">小滴；细流a very small amount of liquid, in a thin stream</sub> of
    cylinders slowed down. For as much as half an hour nothing
    came out of the tube; then one more cylinder, then nothing.
    Everywhere at about the same time the work was easing off.
    A deep and as it were secret sigh went through the Department.
    A mighty deed, which could never be mentioned, had
    been achieved. It was now impossible for any human being
    to prove by documentary evidence that the war with Eurasia
    had ever happened. At twelve hundred it was unexpectedly
    announced that all workers in the Ministry were free till
    tomorrow morning. Winston, still carrying the brief-case
    containing the book, which had remained between his feet
    while he worked and under his body while he slept, went
    home, shaved himself, and almost fell asleep in his bath,
    although the water was barely more than tepid<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">不冷不热的；微温的；温吞的 slightly warm, sometimes in a way that is not pleasant</sub>.

    climbed the stair above Mr Charrington’s shop. He was
    tired, but not sleepy any longer. He opened the window, lit
    the dirty little oil stove and put on a pan of water for coffee.
    Julia would arrive presently<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（表示即将发生）used to show that sth will happen soon</sub>: meanwhile there was the book.
    He sat down in the sluttish<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">邋遢的</sub> armchair and undid the straps<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">带子 a strip of leather, cloth or other material that is used to fasten sth, keep sth in place, carry sth or hold onto sth</sub>
    of the brief-case.

    A heavy black volume, amateurishly<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">外行的；生手的；业余的not done or made well or with skill</sub> bound, with no
    name or title on the cover. The print also looked slightly
    irregular. The pages were worn at the edges, and fell apart,
    easily, as though the book had passed through many hands.
    The inscription<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（书首页的）题词；（石头或金属上）刻写的文字，铭刻，碑文words written in the front of a book or cut in stone or metal</sub> on the title-page ran:

    Throughout recorded time, and probably since the end
    of the Neolithic<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">新石器时代的 of the later part of the Stone Age</sub> Age, there have been three kinds of people
    in the world, the High, the Middle, and the Low. They have
    been subdivided in many ways, they have borne countless
    different names, and their relative numbers, as well as
    their attitude towards one another, have varied from age to
    age: but the essential structure of society has never altered.
    Even after enormous upheavals<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">剧变；激变；动乱；动荡 a big change that causes a lot of confusion, worry and problems</sub> and seemingly irrevocable
    changes, the same pattern has always reasserted itself, just

    Winston stopped reading, chiefly in order to appreciate
    the fact that he was reading, in comfort and safety. He was
    alone: no telescreen, no ear at the keyhole, no nervous impulse
    to glance over his shoulder or cover the page with his
    hand. The sweet summer air played against his cheek. From
    somewhere far away there floated the faint shouts of children:
    in the room itself there was no sound except the insect
    voice of the clock. He settled deeper into the arm-chair and
    put his feet up on the fender. It was bliss<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">极乐 extreme happiness</sub>, it was etemity<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">永恒</sub>.
    Suddenly, as one sometimes does with a book of which one
    knows that one will ultimately read and re-read every word,
    he opened it at a different place and found himself at Chapter III. He went on reading:

        The splitting up of the world into three great super-states
        was an event which could be and indeed was foreseen
        before the middle of the twentieth century. With the absorption
        of Europe by Russia and of the British Empire by
        the United States, two of the three existing powers, Eurasia
        and Oceania, were already effectively in being. The third,
        Eastasia, only emerged as a distinct unit after another decade
        of confused fighting. The frontiers between the three
        super-states are in some places arbitrary, and in others they
        fluctuate according to the fortunes of war, but in general
        they follow geographical lines. <strong>Eurasia</strong> comprises the whole
        of the northern part of the European and Asiatic land-mass,
        from Portugal<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">葡萄牙</sub> to the Bering Strait<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">白令海峡</sub>. <strong>Oceania</strong> comprises the
        Americas, the Atlantic islands including the British Isles,
        Australasia, and the southern portion of Africa. <strong>Eastasia</strong>,
        smaller than the others and with a less definite western
        frontier, comprises China and the countries to the south of
        it, the Japanese islands and a large but fluctuating portion
        of Manchuria<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">满洲〔中国东北的旧称〕</sub>, Mongolia<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">蒙古</sub>, and Tibet<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">西藏</sub>.

</p>

<p>
    <i>
        In one combination or another, these three super-states
        are permanently at war, and have been so for the past twenty-five
        years. War, however, is no longer the desperate,
        annihilating struggle that it was in the early decades of the
        twentieth century. It is a warfare of limited aims between
        combatants who are unable to destroy one another, have no
        material cause for fighting and are not divided by any genuine
        ideological difference. This is not to say that either the
        conduct of war, or the prevailing attitude towards it, has become
        less bloodthirsty or more chivalrous<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（尤指对女人）彬彬有礼的，殷勤的，体贴的polite, kind and behaving with honour, especially towards women</sub>. On the contrary,
        war hysteria<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">大肆鼓吹；狂热夸张；大惊小怪an extremely excited and exaggerated way of behaving or reacting to an event</sub> is continuous and universal in all countries,
        and such acts as raping, looting<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（暴乱、火灾等后）打劫，抢劫，劫掠 to steal things from shops/stores or buildings after a riot , fire, etc.</sub>, the slaughter of children,
        the reduction of whole populations to slavery, and reprisals<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">报复；报复行动a violent or aggressive act towards sb because of sth bad that they have done towards you</sub>
        against prisoners which extend even to boiling and burying
        alive, are looked upon as normal, and, when they are committed
        by one’s own side and not by the enemy, meritorious<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">值得赞扬的 deserving praise</sub>.
        But in a physical sense war involves very small numbers of
        people, mostly highly-trained specialists, and causes comparatively
        few casualties. The fighting, when there is any,
        takes place on the vague frontiers whose whereabouts the
        average man can only guess at, or round the Floating Fortresses
        which guard strategic spots on the sea lanes. In the
        centres of civilization <strong>war means no more than a continuous
        shortage of consumption goods, and the occasional
        crash of a rocket bomb</strong> which may cause a few scores of
        deaths. War has in fact changed its character. More exactly,
        the reasons for which war is waged have changed in their
        order of importance. Motives which were already present
        to some small extent in the great wars of the early twentieth
        century have now become dominant and are consciously
        recognized and acted upon.

    <i>
        To understand the nature of the present war—for in spite
        of the regrouping which occurs every few years, it is always
        the same war—one must realize in the first place that
        it is impossible for it to be decisive. None of the three super-states
        could be definitively conquered even by the other
        two in combination. They are too evenly matched, and their
        natural defences are too formidable. Eurasia is protected by
        its vast land spaces, Oceania by the width of the Atlantic
        and the Pacific, Eastasia by the fecundity<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">多产,富饶,肥沃</sub> and industriousness<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">勤奋精神</sub> of its inhabitants. Secondly, there is no longer, in
        a material sense, anything to fight about. With the establishment
        of self-contained economies, in which production
        and consumption are geared to one another, the scramble<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">争抢；抢占；争夺 a situation in which people push, fight or compete with each other in order to get or do sth</sub>
        for markets which was a main cause of previous wars has
        come to an end, while the competition for raw materials is
        no longer a matter of life and death. In any case each of the
        three super-states is so vast that it can obtain almost all the
        materials that it needs within its own boundaries. In so far
        as the war has a direct economic purpose, it is a war for labour
        power. Between the frontiers of the super-states, and
        not permanently in the possession of any of them, there lies
        a rough quadrilateral<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">四边形a flat shape with four straight sides</sub> with its corners at Tangier<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">丹吉尔〔摩洛哥港市〕</sub>,

        a fifth of the population of the earth. It is for the possession
        of these thickly-populated regions, and of the northern
        ice-cap<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（尤指北极和南极的）冰冠 a layer of ice permanently covering parts of the earth, especially around the North and South Poles</sub>, that the three powers are constantly struggling. In
        practice no one power ever controls the whole of the disputed
        area. Portions of it are constantly changing hands, and

        stroke of treachery<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">背叛；变节；背信弃义 behaviour that involves not being loyal to sb who trusts you; an example of this</sub> that dictates the endless changes of

        as rubber which in colder climates it is necessary to synthesize
        by comparatively expensive methods. But above all
        they contain a bottomless reserve of cheap labour. Whichever
        power controls equatorial<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">赤道的；赤道附近的；赤道地区特有的 near the equator or typical of a country that is near the equator</sub> Africa, or the countries
        of the Middle East, or Southern India, or the Indonesian
        Archipelago, disposes also of the bodies of scores or hundreds
        of millions of ill-paid and hard-working coolies<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">苦力(特指东方的廉价劳动力)</sub>. The
        inhabitants of these areas, reduced more or less openly to
        the status of slaves, pass continually from conqueror to conqueror,
        and are expended like so much coal or oil in the
        race to turn out more armaments<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">军备；武器 weapons, especially large guns, bombs, tanks, etc.</sub>, to capture more territory,
        to control more labour power, to turn out more armaments,
        to capture more territory, and so on indefinitely. It should
        be noted that the fighting never really moves beyond the
        edges of the disputed areas. The frontiers of Eurasia flow
        back and forth between the basin of the Congo and the
        northern shore of the Mediterranean; the islands of the Indian
        Ocean and the Pacific are constantly being captured
        and recaptured by Oceania or by Eastasia; in Mongolia the
        dividing line between Eurasia and Eastasia is never stable;
        round the Pole all three powers lay claim to enormous territories
        which in fact are largely unihabited and unexplored:
        but the balance of power always remains roughly even, and
        the territory which forms the heartland of each super-state
        always remains inviolate<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">未受（或不容）侵犯的；未受（或不容）亵渎的；不容破坏的that has been, or must be, respected and cannot be attacked or destroyed</sub>. Moreover, the labour of the
        exploited peoples round the Equator is not really necessary to
        the world’s economy. They add nothing to the wealth of the
        world, since whatever they produce is used for purposes of
        war, and the object of waging a war is always to be in a better
        position in which to wage another war. By their labour
        the slave populations allow the tempo<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（运动或活动的）速度，节奏 the speed of any movement or activity</sub> of continuous warfare
        to be speeded up. But if they did not exist, the structure
        of world society, and the process by which it maintains itself,
        would not be essentially different.

        <strong>The primary aim of modern warfare</strong> (in accordance
        with the principles of DOUBLETHINK, this aim is simultaneously
        recognized and not recognized by the directing
        brains of the Inner Party) <strong>is to use up the products of the
        machine without raising the general standard of living</strong>.
        Ever since the end of the nineteenth century, the problem of
        what to do with the surplus<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">过剩；剩余；过剩量；剩余额 an amount that is extra or more than you need</sub> of consumption goods has been
        latent<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">潜在的；潜伏的；隐藏的 existing, but not yet very noticeable, active or well developed</sub> in industrial society. At present, when few human beings
        even have enough to eat, this problem is obviously not
        urgent, and it might not have become so, even if no artificial
        processes of destruction had been at work. The world
        of today is a bare, hungry, dilapidated<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">破旧的；破烂的；年久失修的 old and in very bad condition</sub> place compared with
        the world that existed before 1914, and still more so if compared
        with the imaginary future to which the people of that
        period looked forward. In the early twentieth century, the
        vision of a future society unbelievably rich, leisured, orderly,
        and efficient—a glittering<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">辉煌的；成功的 very impressive and successful</sub> antiseptic<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">防腐的；抗菌的 able to prevent infection</sub> world of glass and steel
        and snow-white concrete—was part of the consciousness of
        nearly every literate person. Science and technology were
        developing at a prodigious<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">巨大的；伟大的 very large or powerful and causing surprise or admiration</sub> speed, and it seemed natural to
        assume that they would go on developing. This failed to
        happen, partly because of the impoverishment<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">贫困</sub> caused by a
        long series of wars and revolutions, partly because scientific
        and technical progress depended on the empirical habit of
        thought, which could not survive in a strictly regimented<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">非常严格的；死板的involving strict discipline and/or organization</sub>
        society. As a whole the world is more primitive today than it
        was fifty years ago. Certain backward areas have advanced,
        and various devices, always in some way connected with
        warfare and police espionage<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">间谍活动；谍报活动；刺探活动 the activity of secretly getting important political or military information about another country or of finding out another company's secrets by using spies</sub>, have been developed, but
        experiment and invention have largely stopped, and the
        ravages of the atomic war of the nineteen-fifties have never
        been fully repaired. Nevertheless the dangers inherent
        in the machine are still there. From the moment when the
        machine first made its appearance it was clear to all thinking
        people that the need for human drudgery<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">单调乏味的苦差事；繁重无聊的工作 hard boring work</sub>, and therefore
        to a great extent for human inequality, had disappeared. If
        the machine were used deliberately for that end, hunger,
        overwork, dirt, illiteracy, and disease could be eliminated
        within a few generations. And in fact, without being used
        for any such purpose, but by a sort of automatic process-by
        producing wealth which it was sometimes impossible not
        to distribute—the machine did raise the living standards
        of the average human being very greatly over a period of
        about fifty years at the end of the nineteenth and the
        beginning of the twentieth centuries.

        But it was also clear that an all-round<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">全面的；多方面的including many different subjects, skills, etc.</sub> increase in wealth
        threatened the destruction—indeed, in some sense was the
        destruction—of a hierarchical society. In a world in which
        everyone worked short hours, had enough to eat, lived in a
        house with a bathroom and a refrigerator, and possessed a
        motor-car or even an aeroplane, the most obvious and perhaps
        the most important form of inequality would already
        have disappeared. If it once became general, wealth would
        confer no distinction. It was possible, no doubt, to imagine
        a society in which WEALTH, in the sense of personal possessions
        and luxuries, should be evenly distributed, while
        POWER remained in the hands of a small privileged caste<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（尤指禁止其他等级成员进入的）社会阶层，社会等级a social class, especially one whose members do not allow others to join it</sub>.
        But in practice such a society could not long remain stable.
        For if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike, the
        great mass of human beings who are normally stupefied<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">使惊讶（或惊呆、思维不清、神志不清）to surprise or shock sb; to make sb unable to think clearly</sub> by
        poverty would become literate and would learn to think for
        themselves; and when once they had done this, they would
        sooner or later realize that the privileged minority had no
        function, and they would sweep it away. In the long run,
        a hierarchical society was only possible on a basis of poverty
        and ignorance. To return to the agricultural past, as
        some thinkers about the beginning of the twentieth century
        dreamed of doing, was not a practicable solution. It
        conflicted with the tendency towards mechanization<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">机械化 using machines to do something that was previously done by people or animals</sub> which
        had become quasi-instinctive throughout almost the whole
        world, and moreover, any country which remained industrially
        backward was helpless in a military sense and was
        bound to be dominated, directly or indirectly, by its more
        advanced rivals.

        Nor was it a satisfactory solution to keep the masses in
        poverty by restricting the output of goods. This happened
        to a great extent during the final phase of capitalism, roughly
        between 1920 and 1940. The economy of many countries
        was allowed to stagnate, land went out of cultivation, capital
        equipment was not added to, great blocks of the population
        were prevented from working and kept half alive by
        State charity. But this, too, entailed military weakness, and
        since the privations<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">贫困；匮乏；艰难a lack of the basic things that people need for living</sub> it inflicted were obviously unnecessary,
        it made opposition inevitable. The problem was how
        to keep the wheels of industry turning without increasing
        the real wealth of the world. <strong>Goods must be produced, but
        they must not be distributed. And in practice the only way
        of achieving this was by continuous warfare.</strong>

        The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of
        human lives, but of the products of human labour. War is a
        way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">平流层 the layer of the earth's atmosphere between about 10 and 50 kilometres above the surface of the earth</sub>,
        or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might
        otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and
        hence, in the long run, too intelligent. Even when weapons
        of war are not actually destroyed, their manufacture is still
        a convenient way of expending labour power without producing
        anything that can be consumed. A Floating Fortress,
        for example, has locked up in it the labour that would build
        several hundred cargo-ships. Ultimately it is scrapped<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">废弃；取消；抛弃；报废to cancel or get rid of sth that is no longer practical or useful</sub> as
        obsolete, never having brought any material benefit to
        anybody, and with further enormous labours another Floating
        Fortress is built. In principle the war effort is always so
        planned as to eat up any surplus that might exist after meeting
        the bare needs of the population. In practice the needs
        of the population are always underestimated, with the result
        that there is a chronic shortage of half the necessities
        of life; but this is looked on as an advantage. It is deliberate
        policy to keep even the favoured groups somewhere near
        the brink of hardship, because a general state of scarcity
        increases the importance of small privileges and thus magnifies
        the distinction between one group and another. By
        the standards of the early twentieth century, even a member
        of the Inner Party lives an austere, laborious kind of life.
        Nevertheless, the few luxuries that he does enjoy his large,
        well-appointed flat, the better texture of his clothes, the better
        quality of his food and drink and tobacco, his two or
        three servants, his private motor-car or helicopter—set him
        in a different world from a member of the Outer Party, and
        the members of the Outer Party have a similar advantage
        in comparison with the submerged masses whom we call
        ‘the proles’. The social atmosphere is that of a besieged city,
        where the possession of a lump of horseflesh makes the difference
        between wealth and poverty. And at the same time
        the consciousness of being at war, and therefore in danger,
        makes the handing-over of all power to a small caste seem
        the natural, unavoidable condition of survival.

        War, it will be seen, accomplishes the necessary destruction,
        but accomplishes it in a psychologically acceptable way.
        In principle it would be quite simple to waste the surplus
        labour of the world by building temples and pyramids, by
        digging holes and filling them up again, or even by producing
        vast quantities of goods and then setting fire to them.
        But this would provide only the economic and not the emotional
        basis for a hierarchical society. What is concerned
        here is not the morale of masses, whose attitude is unimportant
        so long as they are kept steadily at work, but the
        morale of the Party itself. Even the humblest Party member
        is expected to be competent, industrious, and even intelligent
        within narrow limits, but it is also necessary that he
        should be a credulous and ignorant fanatic<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">极端分子；狂热信徒a person who holds extreme or dangerous opinions</sub> whose prevailing
        moods are fear, hatred, adulation<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">称赞；吹捧；奉承 admiration and praise, especially when this is greater than is necessary</sub>, and orgiastic<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">纵欲的；放纵的；放荡的typical of an orgy</sub> triumph<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">笔记：这里应该是指对战争胜利的“狂欢”心态</sub>. In
        other words it is necessary that he should have the mentality
        appropriate to a state of war. It does not matter whether
        the war is actually happening, and, since no decisive victory
        is possible, it does not matter whether the war is going well
        or badly. All that is needed is that a state of war should exist.
        The splitting<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">分裂</sub> of the intelligence which the Party requires
        of its members, and which is more easily achieved in an atmosphere
        of war, is now almost universal, but the higher
        up the ranks one goes, the more marked it becomes. It is
        precisely in the Inner Party that war hysteria and hatred of
        the enemy are strongest. In his capacity as an administrator,
        it is often necessary for a member of the Inner Party to
        know that this or that item of war news is untruthful, and
        he may often be aware that the entire war is spurious<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">建立在错误的观念（或思想方法）之上的；谬误的based on false ideas or ways of thinking</sub> and is
        either not happening or is being waged for purposes quite
        other than the declared ones: but such knowledge is easily
        neutralized by the technique of DOUBLETHINK. Meanwhile no
        Inner Party member wavers<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">踌躇；犹豫不决；举棋不定 to hesitate and be unable to make a decision or choice</sub> for an instant in his
        mystical belief that the war is real, and that it is bound to
        end victoriously, with Oceania the undisputed<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">不容置疑的；毫无疑问的；不可争辩的that cannot be questioned or proved to be false; that cannot be disputed</sub> master of

        All members of the Inner Party believe in this coming
        conquest as an article of faith. It is to be achieved either by
        gradually acquiring more and more territory and so building
        up an overwhelming preponderance of power, or by
        the discovery of some new and unanswerable weapon. The
        search for new weapons continues unceasingly, and is one
        of the very few remaining activities in which the inventive
        or speculative type of mind can find any outlet. In Oceania
        at the present day, Science, in the old sense, has almost
        ceased to exist. In Newspeak there is no word for ‘Science’.
        The empirical method of thought, on which all the scientific
        achievements of the past were founded, is opposed to
        the most fundamental principles of Ingsoc. And even technological
        progress only happens when its products can in
        some way be used for the diminution of human liberty. In
        all the useful arts the world is either standing still or going
        backwards. The fields are cultivated with horse-ploughs
        while books are written by machinery. But in matters of
        vital importance—meaning, in effect, war and police espionage—the
        empirical approach is still encouraged, or at least
        tolerated. <strong>The two aims of the Party are to conquer the whole
        surface of the earth and to extinguish once and for all the
        possibility of independent thought.</strong> There are therefore two
        great problems which the Party is concerned to solve. One
        is how to discover, against his will, what another human being
        is thinking, and the other is how to kill several hundred
        million people in a few seconds without giving warning beforehand.
        In so far as scientific research still continues, this
        is its subject matter. The scientist of today is either a mixture
        of psychologist<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">心理学家；心理学研究者 a scientist who studies and is trained in psychology</sub> and inquisitor<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">连续不断地发问的人；（尤指）盘问者a person who asks a lot of difficult questions, especially in a way that makes you feel threatened</sub>, studying with real ordinary

        branches of his special subject as are relevant to the taking
        of life. In the vast laboratories of the Ministry of Peace, and

        the teams of experts are indefatigably<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">不知疲倦地；不厌倦地</sub> at work. Some
        are concerned simply with planning the logistics of future
        wars; others devise larger and larger rocket bombs, more
        and more powerful explosives, and more and more impenetrable
        armour-plating; others search for new and deadlier
        gases, or for soluble poisons capable of being produced in

        But none of these projects ever comes anywhere near realization,
        and none of the three super-states ever gains a
        significant lead on the others. What is more remarkable is
        that all three powers already possess, in the atomic bomb,
        a weapon far more powerful than any that their present
        researches are likely to discover. Although the Party, according
        to its habit, claims the invention for itself, atomic
        bombs first appeared as early as the nineteen-forties, and
        were first used on a large scale about ten years later. At that
        time some hundreds of bombs were dropped on industrial centres,
        chiefly in European Russia, Western Europe,
        and North America. The effect was to convince the ruling
        groups of all countries that a few more atomic bombs would
        mean the end of organized society, and hence of their own
        power. Thereafter, although no formal agreement was ever
        made or hinted at, no more bombs were dropped. All three
        powers merely continue to produce atomic bombs and store
        them up against the decisive opportunity which they all
        believe will come sooner or later. And meanwhile the art
        of war has remained almost stationary for thirty or forty
        years. Helicopters are more used than they were formerly,
        bombing planes have been largely superseded by self-propelled
        projectiles<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（武器发射的）投射物；枪弹；炮弹an object, such as a bullet, that is fired from a gun or other weapon</sub>, and the fragile movable battleship has
        given way to the almost unsinkable Floating Fortress; but
        otherwise there has been little development. The tank, the
        submarine, the torpedo, the machine gun, even the rifle and
        the hand grenade<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">榴弹；手榴弹；枪榴弹a small bomb that can be thrown by hand or fired from a gun</sub> are still in use. And in spite of the endless
        slaughters reported in the Press and on the telescreens,
        the desperate battles of earlier wars, in which hundreds of
        thousands or even millions of men were often killed in a
        few weeks, have never been repeated.

        None of the three super-states ever attempts any manoeuvre<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">军事演习；作战演习military exercises involving a large number of soldiers, ships, etc.</sub>
        which involves the risk of serious defeat. When
        any large operation is undertaken, it is usually a surprise
        attack against an ally. The strategy that all three powers are
        following, or pretend to themselves that they are following,
        is the same. The plan is, by a combination of fighting, bargaining,
        and well-timed strokes<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（成功的）举动；（高明的）举措；（巧妙的）办法；（成功的）事情a single successful action or event</sub> of treachery, to acquire a
        ring of bases completely encircling one or other of the rival
        states, and then to sign a pact of friendship with that
        rival and remain on peaceful terms for so many years as to
        lull<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">缓和；使放松</sub> suspicion to sleep. During this time rockets loaded with
        atomic bombs can be assembled at all the strategic spots;
        finally they will all be fired simultaneously, with effects so
        devastating as to make retaliation impossible. It will then be
        time to sign a pact of friendship with the remaining world-power,
        in preparation for another attack. This scheme, it is
        hardly necessary to say, is a mere daydream, impossible of
        realization. Moreover, no fighting ever occurs except in the
        disputed areas round the Equator and the Pole: no invasion
        of enemy territory is ever undertaken. This explains the fact
        that in some places the frontiers between the superstates
        are arbitrary. Eurasia, for example, could easily conquer the
        British Isles, which are geographically part of Europe, or on
        the other hand it would be possible for Oceania to push its
        frontiers to the Rhine or even to the Vistula. But this would
        violate the principle, followed on all sides though never
        formulated, of cultural integrity. If Oceania were to conquer
        the areas that used once to be known as France and
        Germany, it would be necessary either to exterminate the
        inhabitants, a task of great physical difficulty, or to assimilate
        a population of about a hundred million people, who,
        so far as technical development goes, are roughly on the
        Oceanic level. The problem is the same for all three superstates.
        It is absolutely necessary to their structure that there
        should be no contact with foreigners, except, to a limited
        extent, with war prisoners and coloured slaves. Even the official
        ally of the moment is always regarded with the darkest
        suspicion. War prisoners apart, the average citizen of Oceania
        never sets eyes on a citizen of either Eurasia or Eastasia,
        and he is forbidden the knowledge of foreign languages. If
        he were allowed contact with foreigners he would discover
        that they are creatures similar to himself and that most of
        what he has been told about them is lies. The sealed world
        in which he lives would be broken, and the fear, hatred,
        and self-righteousness<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">自以为是</sub> on which his morale depends might
        evaporate. It is therefore realized on all sides that however
        often Persia<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">波斯</sub>, or Egypt, or Java, or Ceylon<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">锡兰〔亚洲〕</sub> may change hands,
        the main frontiers must never be crossed by anything except bombs.

        Under this lies a fact never mentioned aloud, but tacitly
        understood and acted upon: namely, that <strong>the conditions of
        life in all three super-states are very much the same.</strong> In Oceania
        the prevailing philosophy is called Ingsoc<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">英社党；大洋国施行英国社会主义</sub>, in Eurasia
        it is called Neo-Bolshevism<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">新布尔什维克主义</sub>, and in Eastasia it is called by
        a Chinese name usually translated as Death-Worship, but
        perhaps better rendered as Obliteration of the Self. The citizen
        of Oceania is not allowed to know anything of the tenets
        of the other two philosophies, but he is taught to execrate<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">咒骂；憎恶</sub>
        them as barbarous outrages upon morality and common
        sense. Actually the three philosophies are barely distinguishable,
        and the social systems which they support are
        not distinguishable at all. Everywhere there is the same pyramidal
        structure, the same worship of semi-divine leader,
        the same economy existing by and for continuous warfare.
        It follows that the three super-states not only cannot conquer
        one another, but would gain no advantage by doing
        so. On the contrary, so long as they remain in conflict they
        prop<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">支撑</sub> one another up, like three sheaves<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（收割的）小麦捆a bunch of wheat tied together after being cut</sub> of corn. And, as
        usual, the ruling groups of all three powers are simultaneously
        aware and unaware of what they are doing. Their lives
        are dedicated to world conquest, but they also know that it
        is necessary that the war should continue everlastingly and
        without victory. Meanwhile the fact that there IS no danger
        of conquest makes possible the denial of reality which is the
        special feature of Ingsoc and its rival systems of thought.
        Here it is necessary to repeat what has been said earlier, that
        by becoming continuous war has fundamentally changed
        its character.

        In past ages, a war, almost by definition, was something
        that sooner or later came to an end, usually in unmistakable<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">不会弄错的；确定无疑的；清楚明白的that cannot be mistaken for sb/sth else</sub>
        victory or defeat. In the past, also, war was one of the
        main instruments by which human societies were kept in
        touch with physical reality. <strong>All rulers in all ages have tried
        to impose a false view of the world upon their followers, but
        they could not afford to encourage any illusion that tended
        to impair military efficiency.</strong> So long as defeat meant the
        loss of independence, or some other result generally held
        to be undesirable, the precautions against defeat had to be
        serious. Physical facts could not be ignored. <strong>In philosophy,
        or religion, or ethics, or politics, two and two might make
        five, but when one was designing a gun or an aeroplane they
        had to make four.</strong> Inefficient nations were always conquered
        sooner or later, and the struggle for efficiency was inimical<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">对…有害的；不利于…的harmful to sth; not helping sth</sub>
        to illusions. Moreover, to be efficient it was necessary to
        be able to learn from the past, which meant having a fairly
        accurate idea of what had happened in the past. Newspapers
        and history books were, of course, always coloured and
        biased, but falsification of the kind that is practised today
        would have been impossible. War was a sure safeguard of
        sanity<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">精神健全；神志正常the state of having a normal healthy mind</sub>, and so far as the ruling classes were concerned it was
        probably the most important of all safeguards. <strong>While wars
        could be won or lost, no ruling class could be completely irresponsible.</strong>

        But when war becomes literally continuous, it also ceases
        to be dangerous. When war is continuous there is no such
        thing as military necessity. Technical progress can cease
        and the most palpable facts can be denied or disregarded.
        As we have seen, researches that could be called scientific
        are still carried out for the purposes of war, but they are essentially
        a kind of daydreaming, and their failure to show
        results is not important. Efficiency, even military efficiency,
        is no longer needed. Nothing is efficient in Oceania except
        the Thought Police. Since each of the three super-states is
        unconquerable, each is in effect a separate universe within
        which almost any perversion<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">颠倒；歪曲；颠倒是非the act of changing sth that is good or right into sth that is bad or wrong; the result of this</sub> of thought can be safely practised.
        Reality only exerts its pressure through the needs of
        everyday life—the need to eat and drink, to get shelter and
        clothing, to avoid swallowing poison or stepping out of top-storey
        windows, and the like. Between life and death, and
        between physical pleasure and physical pain, there is still
        a distinction, but that is all. Cut off from contact with the
        outer world, and with the past, the citizen of Oceania is
        like a man in interstellar<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">星际的 between the stars in the sky</sub> space, who has no way of knowing
        which direction is up and which is down. The rulers of
        such a state are absolute, as the Pharaohs or the Caesars
        could not be. They are obliged to prevent their followers
        from starving to death in numbers large enough to be inconvenient,
        and they are obliged to remain at the same
        low level of military technique as their rivals; but once that
        minimum is achieved, they can twist reality into whatever
        shape they choose.

        The war, therefore, if we judge it by the standards of previous
        wars, is merely an imposture<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">冒名行骗 an act of tricking people deliberately by pretending to be sb else</sub>. It is like the battles
        between certain ruminant<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">反刍动物 any animal that brings back food from its stomach and chews it again. Cows and sheep are both ruminants.</sub> animals whose horns are set at
        such an angle that they are incapable of hurting one another.
        But though it is unreal it is not meaningless. It eats up
        the surplus of consumable goods, and it helps to preserve
        the special mental atmosphere that a hierarchical society
        needs. War, it will be seen, is now a purely internal affair.
        In the past, the ruling groups of all countries, although
        they might recognize their common interest and therefore
        limit the destructiveness of war, did fight against one another,
        and the victor always plundered<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（尤指战乱时用武力）抢劫，掠夺 to steal things from a place, especially using force during a time of war</sub> the vanquished<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">战败者；被完全征服的人；败阵者 people who have been completely defeated in a competition, war, etc.</sub>. In
        our own day they are not fighting against one another at
        all. The war is waged by each ruling group against its own
        subjects, and the object of the war is not to make or prevent
        conquests of territory, but to keep the structure of society
        intact. The very word ‘war’, therefore, has become misleading.
        It would probably be accurate to say that by becoming
        continuous war has ceased to exist. The peculiar pressure
        that it exerted on human beings between the Neolithic Age
        and the early twentieth century has disappeared and been
        replaced by something quite different. The effect would be
        much the same if the three super-states, instead of fighting
        one another, should agree to live in perpetual peace, each
        inviolate<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">未受（或不容）侵犯的；未受（或不容）亵渎的；不容破坏的that has been, or must be, respected and cannot be attacked or destroyed</sub> within its own boundaries. For in that case each

        the sobering<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">令人警醒的；使人冷静的 making you feel serious and think carefully</sub> influence of external danger. <strong>A peace that was
        truly permanent would be the same as a permanent war.</strong>
        This—although the vast majority of Party members understand
        it only in a shallower sense—is the inner meaning of
        the Party slogan: WAR IS PEACE.

    Winston stopped reading for a moment. Somewhere in
    remote distance a rocket bomb thundered. The blissful feeling
    of being alone with the forbidden book, in a room with
    no telescreen, had not worn off. Solitude and safety were
    physical sensations, mixed up somehow with the tiredness
    of his body, the softness of the chair, the touch of the faint
    breeze from the window that played upon his cheek. <strong>The
    book fascinated him, or more exactly it reassured him. In
    a sense it told him nothing that was new, but that was part
    of the attraction. It said what he would have said, if it had
    been possible for him to set his scattered thoughts in order.</strong>
    It was the product of a mind similar to his own, but
    enormously more powerful, more systematic, less fear-ridden.
    <strong>The best books, he perceived, are those that tell you
    what you know already.</strong> He had just turned back to Chapter
    I when he heard Julia’s footstep on the stair and started out
    of his chair to meet her. She dumped her brown tool-bag on
    the floor and flung herself into his arms. It was more than a
    week since they had seen one another.

    They did not return to the subject until they had been
    in bed for half an hour. The evening was just cool enough
    to make it worth while to pull up the counterpane<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">床单；棉床罩</sub>. From
    below came the familiar sound of singing and the scrape
    of boots on the flagstones<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">石板（方形，用于铺地面、小径等）a large flat square piece of stone that is used for floors, paths, etc.</sub>. The brawny<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">健壮的；肌肉发达的having strong muscles</sub> red-armed woman
    whom Winston had seen there on his first visit was almost a
    fixture in the yard. There seemed to be no hour of daylight
    when she was not marching to and fro between the washtub
    and the line, alternately gagging herself with clothes pegs<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">晾衣夹子 a piece of wood or plastic used for attaching wet clothes to a clothes line</sub>
    and breaking forth into lusty<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">健壮的；强壮的 healthy and strong</sub> song. Julia had settled down
    on her side and seemed to be already on the point of falling
    asleep. He reached out for the book, which was lying on the
    floor, and sat up against the bedhead.

    That’s the best way. Then you can explain it to me as you go.’

    <i>
        Throughout recorded time, and probably since the end
        of the Neolithic Age, there have been three kinds of people
        in the world, the High, the Middle, and the Low. They have
        been subdivided in many ways, they have borne countless
        different names, and their relative numbers, as well as
        their attitude towards one another, have varied from age to
        age: but the essential structure of society has never altered.
        Even after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocable
        changes, the same pattern has always reasserted itself, just
        as a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium, however
        far it is pushed one way or the other.

<p>
    ‘Julia, are you awake?’ said Winston.
</p>

<p>
    ‘Yes, my love, I’m listening. Go on. It’s marvellous.’
</p>

<p>
    He continued reading:
</p>

<p>
    <i>
        The aims of these three groups are entirely irreconcilable.
        The aim of the High is to remain where they are. The
        aim of the Middle is to change places with the High. The
        aim of the Low, when they have an aim—for it is an abiding<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">持久的；长久的；始终不渝的lasting for a long time and not changing</sub>
        characteristic of the Low that they are too much crushed
        by drudgery<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">单调乏味的苦差事；繁重无聊的工作hard boring work</sub> to be more than intermittently<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">断断续续地;间歇地</sub> conscious of
        anything outside their daily lives—is to abolish all distinctions
        and create a society in which all men shall be equal.
        Thus throughout history a struggle which is the same in its
        main outlines recurs over and over again. For long periods
        the High seem to be securely in power, but sooner or later
        there always comes a moment when they lose either their
        belief in themselves or their capacity to govern efficiently,
        or both. They are then overthrown by the Middle, who enlist<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">争取，谋取（帮助、支持或参与）to persuade sb to help you or to join you in doing sth</sub>
        the Low on their side by pretending to them that they
        are fighting for liberty and justice. As soon as they have
        reached their objective, the Middle thrust the Low back
        into their old position of servitude<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">奴役（状况）；任人差遣（的状况）the condition of being a slave or being forced to obey another person</sub>, and themselves become
        the High. Presently a new Middle group splits off from one
        of the other groups, or from both of them, and the struggle
        begins over again. Of the three groups, only the Low are
        never even temporarily successful in achieving their aims.
        It would be an exaggeration to say that throughout history
        there has been no progress of a material kind. Even today,
        in a period of decline, the average human being is physically
        better off than he was a few centuries ago. But no advance
        in wealth, no softening of manners, no reform or revolution
        has ever brought human equality a millimetre nearer.
        From the point of view of the Low, no historic change has
        ever meant much more than a change in the name of their
        masters.

    <i>
        By the late nineteenth century the recurrence of this pattern
        had become obvious to many observers. There then
        rose schools of thinkers who interpreted history as a cyclical
        process and claimed to show that inequality was the
        unalterable law of human life. This doctrine, of course, had
        always had its adherents, but in the manner in which it was
        now put forward there was a significant change. In the past
        the need for a hierarchical form of society had been the doctrine
        specifically of the High. It had been preached by kings
        and aristocrats<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">贵族 a member of the aristocracy</sub> and by the priests, lawyers, and the like who
        were parasitical upon them, and it had generally been softened
        by promises of compensation in an imaginary world
        beyond the grave. The Middle, so long as it was struggling
        for power, had always made use of such terms as freedom,
        justice, and fraternity<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（有相同职业、爱好或信仰的）群体，同人；同好a group of people sharing the same profession, interests or beliefs</sub>. Now, however, the concept of human
        brotherhood began to be assailed by people who were
        not yet in positions of command, but merely hoped to be so
        before long. In the past the Middle had made revolutions
        under the banner of equality, and then had established a
        fresh tyranny as soon as the old one was overthrown. The
        new Middle groups in effect proclaimed their tyranny beforehand.
        Socialism, a theory which appeared in the early
        nineteenth century and was the last link in a chain of
        thought stretching back to the slave rebellions of antiquity,
        was still deeply infected by the Utopianism of past ages. But
        in each variant of Socialism that appeared from about 1900
        onwards the aim of establishing liberty and equality was
        more and more openly abandoned. The new movements
        which appeared in the middle years of the century, Ingsoc
        in Oceania, Neo-Bolshevism in Eurasia, Death-Worship, as
        it is commonly called, in Eastasia, had the conscious aim
        of perpetuating UNfreedom and INequality. These new
        movements, of course, grew out of the old ones and tended
        to keep their names and pay lip-service<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">空口的应酬话；口惠if sb pays lip service to sth, they say that they approve of it or support it, without proving their support by what they actually do</sub> to their ideology.
        But the purpose of all of them was to arrest progress and
        freeze history at a chosen moment. The familiar pendulum
        swing was to happen once more, and then stop. As usual,
        the High were to be turned out by the Middle, who would
        then become the High; but this time, by conscious strategy,
        the High would be able to maintain their position permanently.

    <i>
        The new doctrines arose partly because of the accumulation
        of historical knowledge, and the growth of the
        historical sense, which had hardly existed before the nineteenth
        century. The cyclical movement of history was now
        intelligible, or appeared to be so; and if it was intelligible,
        then it was alterable. But the principal, underlying cause
        was that, as early as the beginning of the twentieth century,
        human equality had become technically possible. It was still
        true that men were not equal in their native talents and that
        functions had to be specialized in ways that favoured some
        individuals against others; but there was no longer any real
        need for class distinctions or for large differences of wealth.
        In earlier ages, class distinctions had been not only inevitable
        but desirable. Inequality was the price of civilization.
        With the development of machine production, however, the
        case was altered. Even if it was still necessary for human
        beings to do different kinds of work, it was no longer necessary
        for them to live at different social or economic levels.
        Therefore, from the point of view of the new groups who
        were on the point of seizing power, human equality was no
        longer an ideal to be striven after, but a danger to be averted.
        In more primitive ages, when a just and peaceful society
        was in fact not possible, it had been fairly easy to believe it.
        The idea of an earthly paradise in which men should live
        together in a state of brotherhood, without laws and without
        brute labour, had haunted the human imagination for
        thousands of years. And this vision had had a certain hold
        even on the groups who actually profited by each historical change.
        The heirs of the French, English, and American
        revolutions had partly believed in their own phrases about
        the rights of man, freedom of speech, equality before the
        law, and the like, and have even allowed their conduct to
        be influenced by them to some extent. But by the fourth
        decade of the twentieth century all the main currents of
        political thought were authoritarian<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">威权主义的；专制的believing that people should obey authority and rules, even when these are unfair, and even if it means that they lose their personal freedom</sub>. The earthly paradise
        had been discredited at exactly the moment when it became
        realizable. Every new political theory, by whatever name it
        called itself, led back to hierarchy and regimentation. And
        in the general hardening of outlook that set in round about
        1930, practices which had been long abandoned, in some
        cases for hundreds of years—imprisonment without trial,
        the use of war prisoners as slaves, public executions, torture
        to extract confessions, the use of hostages, and the deportation
        of whole populations—not only became common
        again, but were tolerated and even defended by people who
        considered themselves enlightened and progressive.

        It was only after a decade of national wars, civil wars,
        revolutions, and counter-revolutions in all parts of the
        world that Ingsoc and its rivals emerged as fully worked-out
        political theories. But they had been foreshadowed by
        the various systems, generally called totalitarian, which
        had appeared earlier in the century, and the main outlines
        of the world which would emerge from the prevailing chaos
        had long been obvious. What kind of people would control
        this world had been equally obvious. The new aristocracy
        was made up for the most part of bureaucrats<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">官僚主义者；官僚 an official working in an organization or a government department, especially one who follows the rules of the department too strictly</sub>, scientists,
        technicians, trade-union organizers, publicity experts, sociologists,
        teachers, journalists, and professional politicians.
        These people, whose origins lay in the salaried middle class
        and the upper grades of the working class, had been shaped
        and brought together by the barren world of monopoly industry
        and centralized government. <strong>As compared with
        their opposite numbers in past ages, they were less avaricious,
        less tempted by luxury, hungrier for pure power, and,
        above all, more conscious of what they were doing and
        more intent on crushing opposition.</strong> This last difference was
        cardinal. By comparison with that existing today, all the
        tyrannies of the past were half-hearted and inefficient. The
        ruling groups were always infected to some extent by liberal
        ideas, and were content to leave loose ends everywhere,
        to regard only the overt act and to be uninterested in what
        their subjects were thinking. Even the Catholic Church of
        the Middle Ages was tolerant by modern standards. Part of
        the reason for this was that in the past no government had
        the power to keep its citizens under constant surveillance.
        The invention of print, however, made it easier to manipulate
        public opinion, and the film and the radio carried the
        process further. With the development of television, and
        the technical advance which made it possible to receive and
        transmit simultaneously on the same instrument, private
        life came to an end. Every citizen, or at least every citizen
        important enough to be worth watching, could be kept for
        twenty-four hours a day under the eyes of the police and in
        the sound of official propaganda, with all other channels
        of communication closed. The possibility of enforcing not
        only complete obedience to the will of the State, but complete
        uniformity of opinion on all subjects, now existed for
        the first time.

        After the revolutionary period of the fifties and sixties,
        society regrouped itself, as always, into High, Middle, and
        Low. But the new High group, unlike all its forerunners, did
        not act upon instinct but knew what was needed to safeguard
        its position. It had long been realized that the only secure
        basis for oligarchy<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">寡头政治 a form of government in which only a small group of people hold all the power</sub> is collectivism<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">集体主义；（一切农场、工商企业都归政府或全民所有的）公有制 the political system in which all farms, businesses and industries are owned by the government or by all the people</sub>. Wealth and privilege are
        most easily defended when they are possessed jointly<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">共同地</sub>. The
        so-called ‘abolition of private property’ which took place in
        the middle years of the century meant, in effect, the concentration
        of property in far fewer hands than before: but
        with this difference, that the new owners were a group instead
        of a mass of individuals. Individually, no member of
        the Party owns anything, except petty personal belongings.
        Collectively, the Party owns everything in Oceania, because
        it controls everything, and disposes of the products
        as it thinks fit. In the years following the Revolution it was
        able to step into this commanding position almost unopposed,
        because the whole process was represented as an act
        of collectivization<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">集体化；集体化政策</sub>. It had always been assumed that if the
        capitalist class were expropriated<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">没收(财产等)；征用(土地)</sub>, Socialism must follow:
        and unquestionably the capitalists had been expropriated.
        Factories, mines, land, houses, transport—everything had
        been taken away from them: and since these things were
        no longer private property, it followed that they must be
        public property. Ingsoc, which grew out of the earlier Socialist
        movement and inherited its phraseology<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">措辞；遣词造句 the particular way in which words and phrases are arranged when saying or writing sth</sub>, has in fact
        carried out the main item in the Socialist programme; with
        the result, foreseen and intended beforehand, that economic
        inequality has been made permanent.

        But the problems of perpetuating a hierarchical society go
        deeper than this. There are only four ways in which
        a ruling group can fall from power. Either it is conquered
        from without<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">笔记：这里应该是指外部，也就是另外两个超级大国</sub>, or it governs so inefficiently that the masses
        are stirred to revolt, or it allows a strong and discontented
        Middle group to come into being, or it loses its own self-confidence
        and willingness to govern. These causes do not
        operate singly, and as a rule all four of them are present in
        some degree. A ruling class which could guard against all
        of them would remain in power permanently. Ultimately
        the determining factor is the mental attitude of the ruling
        class itself.

        After the middle of the present century, the first danger
        had in reality disappeared. Each of the three powers
        which now divide the world is in fact unconquerable, and
        could only become conquerable through slow demographic<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">人口统计数据 data relating to the population and different groups within it</sub>
        changes which a government with wide powers can easily avert.
        The second danger, also, is only a theoretical one.
        The masses never revolt of their own accord, and they never
        revolt merely because they are oppressed. Indeed, so long
        as they are not permitted to have standards of comparison,
        they never even become aware that they are oppressed. The
        recurrent economic crises of past times were totally unnecessary
        and are not now permitted to happen, but other
        and equally large dislocations<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">混乱；位移</sub> can and do happen without
        having political results, because there is no way in which
        discontent can become articulate. As for the problem of
        over-production, which has been latent in our society since
        the development of machine technique, it is solved by the
        device of continuous warfare (see Chapter III), which is
        also useful in keying up public morale to the necessary
        pitch. From the point of view of our present rulers, therefore,
        the only genuine dangers are the splitting-off of a new
        group of able, under-employed, power-hungry people, and
        the growth of liberalism and scepticism in their own ranks.
        The problem, that is to say, is educational. It is a problem
        of continuously moulding the consciousness both of the
        directing group and of the larger executive group that lies
        immediately below it. The consciousness of the masses
        needs only to be influenced in a negative way.

        Given this background, one could infer, if one did not
        know it already, the general structure of Oceanic society. At
        the apex of the pyramid comes Big Brother. Big Brother is infallible<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">永无过失的；一贯正确的never wrong; never making mistakes</sub>
        and all-powerful. Every success, every achievement,
        every victory, every scientific discovery, all knowledge, all
        wisdom, all happiness, all virtue, are held to issue directly
        from his leadership and inspiration. Nobody has ever seen
        Big Brother. He is a face on the hoardings<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">大幅广告牌a large board on the outside of a building or at the side of the road, used for putting advertisements on</sub>, a voice on the
        telescreen. We may be reasonably sure that he will never die,
        and there is already considerable uncertainty as to when he
        was born. Big Brother is the guise in which the Party chooses
        to exhibit itself to the world. His function is to act as a
        focusing point for love, fear, and reverence, emotions which
        are more easily felt towards an individual than towards an
        organization. Below Big Brother comes the Inner Party. Its
        numbers limited to six millions, or something less than
        2 per cent of the population of Oceania. Below the Inner
        Party comes the Outer Party, which, if the Inner Party is described
        as the brain of the State, may be justly likened to the
        hands. Below that come the dumb masses whom we habitually
        refer to as ‘the proles’, numbering perhaps 85 per cent of
        the population. In the terms of our earlier classification, the
        proles are the Low: for the slave population of the equatorial
        lands who pass constantly from conqueror to conqueror,
        are not a permanent or necessary part of the structure.

        In principle, membership of these three groups is not hereditary<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">遗传的；遗传性的given to a child by its parents before it is born</sub>.
        The child of Inner Party parents is in theory not
        born into the Inner Party. Admission to either branch of the
        Party is by examination, taken at the age of sixteen. Nor is
        there any racial discrimination, or any marked domination
        of one province by another. Jews, Negroes, South Americans
        of pure Indian blood are to be found in the highest
        ranks of the Party, and the administrators of any area are
        always drawn from the inhabitants of that area. In no part
        of Oceania do the inhabitants have the feeling that they are
        a colonial population ruled from a distant capital. Oceania
        has no capital, and its titular head is a person whose
        whereabouts nobody knows. Except that English is its chief
        LINGUA FRANCA and Newspeak its official language, it is
        not centralized in any way. Its rulers are not held together
        by blood-ties but by adherence to a common doctrine. It
        is true that our society is stratified, and very rigidly stratified,
        on what at first sight appear to be hereditary lines.
        There is far less to-and-fro movement between the different
        groups than happened under capitalism or even in the
        pre-industrial age. Between the two branches of the Party
        there is a certain amount of interchange, but only so much
        as will ensure that weaklings<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">瘦弱的人；弱不禁风的人 a person who is not physically strong</sub> are excluded from the Inner
        Party and that ambitious members of the Outer Party are
        made harmless by allowing them to rise. Proletarians, in
        practice, are not allowed to graduate into the Party. The
        most gifted among them, who might possibly become nuclei
        of discontent, are simply marked down by the Thought
        Police and eliminated. But this state of affairs is not necessarily
        permanent, nor is it a matter of principle. The Party
        is not a class in the old sense of the word. It does not aim
        at transmitting power to its own children, as such; and if
        there were no other way of keeping the ablest people at the
        top, it would be perfectly prepared to recruit an entire new
        generation from the ranks of the proletariat. In the crucial
        years, the fact that the Party was not a hereditary body did
        a great deal to neutralize opposition. The older kind of Socialist,
        who had been trained to fight against something
        called ‘class privilege’ assumed that what is not hereditary
        cannot be permanent. He did not see that the continuity
        of an oligarchy need not be physical, nor did he pause to
        reflect that hereditary aristocracies have always been short-lived,
        whereas adoptive organizations such as the Catholic
        Church have sometimes lasted for hundreds or thousands
        of years. The essence of oligarchical rule is not father-to-son
        inheritance, but the persistence of a certain world-view and
        a certain way of life, imposed by the dead upon the living. A
        ruling group is a ruling group so long as it can nominate its
        successors. The Party is not concerned with perpetuating
        its blood but with perpetuating itself. WHO wields power
        is not important, provided that the hierarchical structure
        remains always the same.

        All the beliefs, habits, tastes, emotions, mental attitudes
        that characterize our time are really designed to sustain the
        mystique of the Party and prevent the true nature of present-day
        society from being perceived. Physical rebellion, or
        any preliminary move towards rebellion, is at present not
        possible. From the proletarians nothing is to be feared. Left
        to themselves, they will continue from generation to generation
        and from century to century, working, breeding, and
        dying, not only without any impulse to rebel, but without
        the power of grasping that the world could be other than it
        is. They could only become dangerous if the advance of industrial
        technique made it necessary to educate them more
        highly; but, since military and commercial rivalry are no
        longer important, the level of popular education is actually
        declining. What opinions the masses hold, or do not hold,
        is looked on as a matter of indifference. They can be granted
        intellectual liberty because they have no intellect. In a Party
        member, on the other hand, not even the smallest deviation
        of opinion on the most unimportant subject can be tolerated.

        A Party member lives from birth to death under the eye
        of the Thought Police. Even when he is alone he can never be
        sure that he is alone. Wherever he may be, asleep or awake,
        working or resting, in his bath or in bed, he can be inspected
        without warning and without knowing that he is being inspected.
        Nothing that he does is indifferent. His friendships,
        his relaxations, his behaviour towards his wife and children,
        the expression of his face when he is alone, the words he
        mutters in sleep, even the characteristic movements of his
        body, are all jealously scrutinized. Not only any actual misdemeanour,
        but any eccentricity, however small, any change
        of habits, any nervous mannerism that could possibly be
        the symptom of an inner struggle, is certain to be detected.
        He has no freedom of choice in any direction whatever. On
        the other hand his actions are not regulated by law or by any
        clearly formulated code of behaviour. In Oceania there is
        no law. Thoughts and actions which, when detected, mean
        certain death are not formally forbidden, and the endless
        purges, arrests, tortures, imprisonments, and vaporizations
        are not inflicted as punishment for crimes which have actually
        been committed, but are merely the wiping-out of
        persons who might perhaps commit a crime at some time in
        the future. A Party member is required to have not only the
        right opinions, but the right instincts. Many of the beliefs
        and attitudes demanded of him are never plainly stated, and
        could not be stated without laying bare the contradictions
        inherent in Ingsoc. If he is a person naturally orthodox (in
        Newspeak a GOODTHINKER), he will in all circumstances know,
        without taking thought, what is the true belief or
        the desirable emotion. But in any case an elaborate mental
        training, undergone in childhood and grouping itself
        round the Newspeak words CRIMESTOP, BLACKWHITE,
        and DOUBLETHINK, makes him unwilling and unable to
        think too deeply on any subject whatever.

        continuous frenzy of hatred of foreign enemies and internal

        early acquired inner discipline. The first and simplest stage
        in the discipline, which can be taught even to young children,
        is called, in Newspeak, CRIMESTOP. CRIMESTOP
        means the faculty of stopping short<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">猛然停止；使(谈话等)停止</sub>, as though by instinct,
        at the threshold of any dangerous thought. It includes the
        power of not grasping analogies, of failing to perceive logical
        errors, of misunderstanding the simplest arguments if
        they are inimical<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">对…有害的；不利于…的harmful to sth; not helping sth</sub> to Ingsoc, and of being bored or repelled
        by any train of thought which is capable of leading in a
        heretical<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">异端的</sub> direction. CRIMESTOP, in short, means protective
        stupidity. But stupidity is not enough. On the contrary,
        orthodoxy in the full sense demands a control over one’s
        own mental processes as complete as that of a contortionist<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">柔体杂技演员 a performer who does contortions of their body to entertain others</sub>
        over his body. Oceanic society rests ultimately on the
        belief that Big Brother is omnipotent<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">万能的；全能的；无所不能的 having total power; able to do anything</sub> and that the Party is
        infallible. But since in reality Big Brother is not omnipotent

        facts. The keyword here is BLACKWHITE. Like so many
        Newspeak words, this word has two mutually contradictory meanings.
        Applied to an opponent, it means the habit of
        impudently<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">无礼地,鲁莽地,冒失地</sub> claiming that black is white, in contradiction of
        the plain facts. Applied to a Party member, it means a loyal
        willingness to say that black is white when Party discipline
        demands this. But it means also the ability to BELIEVE that
        black is white, and more, to KNOW that black is white, and
        to forget that one has ever believed the contrary. This demands
        a continuous alteration of the past, made possible
        by the system of thought which really embraces all the rest,
        and which is known in Newspeak as DOUBLETHINK.

The subsidiary reason is that the Party member, like

        countries, because it is necessary for him to believe that
        he is better off than his ancestors and that the average level
        of material comfort is constantly rising. But by far the
        more important reason for the readjustment<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">重新调整</sub> of the past is
        the need to safeguard the infallibility<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">绝对正确</sub> of the Party.<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">笔记：对历史的修改，是为了让Party在人们的认知当中，是一贯正确，是不容有错的。根据下文来说，承认错误，就一定程度上，显示了Party的软弱，所以Party要一直正确。</sub> It is not
        merely that speeches, statistics, and records of every kind
        must be constantly brought up to date in order to show that
        the predictions of the Party were in all cases right. It is also
        that no change in doctrine or in political alignment can
        ever be admitted. <strong>For to change one’s mind, or even one’s
        policy, is a confession of weakness.</strong> If, for example, Eurasia
        or Eastasia (whichever it may be) is the enemy today, then
        that country must always have been the enemy. And if the
        facts say otherwise then the facts must be altered. Thus history
        is continuously rewritten. This day-to-day falsification
        of the past, carried out by the Ministry of Truth, is as necessary
        to the stability of the regime as the work of repression<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">压制；镇压 the act of using force to control a group of people and restrict their freedom</sub>

        The mutability of the past is the central tenet<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">原则；信条；教义 one of the principles or beliefs that a theory or larger set of beliefs is based on</sub> of Ingsoc.
        Past events, it is argued, have no objective existence, but
        survive only in written records and in human memories.
        The past is whatever the records and the memories agree
        upon. And since the Party is in full control of all records
        and in equally full control of the minds of its members, it
        follows that the past is whatever the Party chooses to make
        it. It also follows that though the past is alterable, it never
        has been altered in any specific instance. For when it has
        been recreated in whatever shape is needed at the moment,
        then this new version IS the past, and no different past can
        ever have existed. This holds good even when, as often happens,
        the same event has to be altered out of recognition
        several times in the course of a year. At all times the Party
        is in possession of absolute truth, and clearly the absolute
        can never have been different from what it is now. It will
        be seen that the control of the past depends above all on
        the training of memory. To make sure that all written records
        agree with the orthodoxy of the moment is merely
        a mechanical act. But it is also necessary to REMEMBER
        that events happened in the desired manner. And if it is
        necessary to rearrange one’s memories or to tamper with
        written records, then it is necessary to FORGET that one
        has done so. The trick of doing this can be learned like any
        other mental technique. It is learned by the majority of Party
        members, and certainly by all who are intelligent as well
        as orthodox. In Oldspeak it is called, quite frankly, ‘reality
        control’. In Newspeak it is called DOUBLETHINK, though
        DOUBLETHINK comprises much else as well.

        DOUBLETHINK means the power of holding two
        contradictory beliefs in one’s mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them.
        The Party intellectual knows in which
        direction his memories must be altered; he therefore knows
        that he is playing tricks with reality; but by the exercise of
        DOUBLETHINK he also satisfies himself that reality is not
        violated. The process has to be conscious, or it would not
        be carried out with sufficient precision, but it also has to be
        unconscious, or it would bring with it a feeling of falsity and
        hence of guilt. DOUBLETHINK lies at the very heart of Ingsoc,
        since the essential act of the Party is to use conscious
        deception while retaining the firmness of purpose that goes
        with complete honesty. To tell deliberate lies while genuinely
        believing in them, to forget any fact that has become
        inconvenient, and then, when it becomes necessary again,
        to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed,
        to deny the existence of objective reality and all the while
        to take account of the reality which one denies—all this is
        indispensably necessary. Even in using the word DOUBLETHINK
        it is necessary to exercise DOUBLETHINK. For
        by using the word one admits that one is tampering with
        reality; by a fresh act of DOUBLETHINK one erases this
        knowledge; and so on indefinitely, with the lie always one
        leap ahead of the truth. Ultimately it is by means of DOUBLETHINK
        that the Party has been able—and may, for all
        we know, continue to be able for thousands of years—to arrest the course of history.

        It need hardly be said that the subtlest practitioners of
        DOUBLETHINK are those who invented DOUBLETHINK
        and know that it is a vast system of mental cheating. In
        our society, those who have the best knowledge of what is
        happening are also those who are furthest from seeing the
        world as it is. In general, the greater the understanding, the
        greater the delusion; the more intelligent, the less sane. One
        clear illustration of this is the fact that war hysteria increases
        in intensity as one rises in the social scale. Those whose
        attitude towards the war is most nearly rational are the subject
        peoples of the disputed territories. To these people the
        war is simply a continuous calamity<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">灾难；灾祸 an event that causes great damage to people's lives, property, etc.</sub> which sweeps to and
        fro over their bodies like a tidal wave. Which side is winning
        is a matter of complete indifference to them. They are
        aware that a change of overlordship means simply that they
        will be doing the same work as before for new masters who
        treat them in the same manner as the old ones. The slightly
        more favoured workers whom we call ‘the proles’ are only
        intermittently conscious of the war. When it is necessary
        they can be prodded<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">催促；督促；鼓动 to try to make sb do sth, especially when they are unwilling</sub> into frenzies of fear and hatred, but
        when left to themselves they are capable of forgetting for
        long periods that the war is happening. It is in the ranks of
        the Party, and above all of the Inner Party, that the true war
        enthusiasm is found. World-conquest is believed in most
        firmly by those who know it to be impossible. This peculiar
        linking-together of opposites—knowledge with ignorance,
        cynicism with fanaticism—is one of the chief distinguishing
        marks of Oceanic society. The official ideology abounds
        with contradictions even when there is no practical reason
        for them. Thus, the Party rejects and vilifies<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">污蔑；诽谤；诋毁；中伤to say or write unpleasant things about sb/sth so that other people will have a low opinion of them</sub> every principle
        for which the Socialist movement originally stood, and it
        chooses to do this in the name of Socialism. It preaches a
        contempt for the working class unexampled for centuries
        past, and it dresses its members in a uniform which was at
        one time peculiar to manual workers and was adopted for
        that reason. <strong>It systematically undermines the solidarity of
        the family, and it calls its leader by a name which is a direct
        appeal to the sentiment of family loyalty.</strong> Even the names of
        the four Ministries by which we are governed exhibit a sort
        of impudence<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">厚颜无耻[冒失、无礼]的言行</sub> in their deliberate reversal<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">颠倒；彻底转变；反转；倒置 a change of sth so that it is the opposite of what it was</sub> of the facts.
        <strong>The Ministry of Peace concerns itself with war, the Ministry of
        Truth with lies, the Ministry of Love with torture and the
        Ministry of Plenty with starvation.</strong> These contradictions
        are not accidental, nor do they result from ordinary hypocrisy<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">伪善；虚伪 behaviour in which sb pretends to have moral standards or opinions that they do not actually have</sub>;
        they are deliberate exercises in DOUBLETHINK. For
        it is only by reconciling contradictions that power can be
        retained indefinitely. In no other way could the ancient cycle
        be broken. If human equality is to be for ever averted—if
        the High, as we have called them, are to keep their places
        permanently—then the prevailing mental condition must
        be controlled insanity<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">精神失常；精神错乱；精神病the state of being insane</sub>.

    Winston became aware of silence, as one becomes aware
    of a new sound. It seemed to him that Julia had been very
    still for some time past. She was lying on her side, naked
    from the waist upwards, with her cheek pillowed on
    her hand and one dark lock<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">一绺（或一缕）头发 a few hairs that hang or lie together on your head</sub> tumbling<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">轻松地倒下 to move or fall somewhere in a relaxed, uncontrolled, or noisy way</sub> across her eyes. Her

<p>
    ‘Julia.’
</p>

<p>
    No answer.
</p>

<p>
    ‘Julia, are you awake?’
</p>

<p>
    No answer. She was asleep. He shut the book, put it carefully
    on the floor, lay down, and pulled the coverlet<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">床罩 a type of bedspread to cover a bed</sub> over
    both of them.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>

    He had still, he reflected, not learned the ultimate secret.
    He understood HOW; he did not understand WHY. Chapter I,
    like Chapter III, had not actually told him anything
    that he did not know, it had merely systematized the knowledge
    that he possessed already. But after reading it he knew
    better than before that he was not mad. Being in a minority,
    even a minority of one, did not make you mad. There was
    truth and there was untruth, and if you clung to the truth
    even against the whole world, you were not mad. A yellow
    beam from the sinking sun slanted<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">倾斜，歪斜 to slope or to make sth slope in a particular direction or at a particular angle</sub> in through the window
    and fell across the pillow. He shut his eyes. The sun on his
    face and the girl’s smooth body touching his own gave him
    a strong, sleepy, confident feeling. He was safe, everything
    was all right. He fell asleep murmuring ‘Sanity<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">精神健全；神志正常the state of having a normal healthy mind</sub> is not statistical,’<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">笔记：我觉得，Sanity is not statistical，这句话的意思是说，判断一个人的心智是否健全，并不是根据人数多少来判断的。换句话说，并不是说占用某种观念的人数多，就代表这种观念是正常的、正确的观念，也并不是说占用有某观念的人数少，就表示拥有这种观念的人是不正确的、神志是不正常的。</sub>

    profound wisdom.

    When he woke it was with the sensation of having slept
    for a long time, but a glance at the old-fashioned clock told
    him that it was only twenty-thirty. He lay dozing for a while;
    then the usual deep-lunged<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">声音洪亮的</sub> singing struck up from the yard
    below:
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>

<p>
    The driveling song seemed to have kept its popularity.
    You still heard it all over the place. It had outlived the Hate
    Song. Julia woke at the sound, stretched herself luxuriously,
    and got out of bed.
</p>

<p>
    ‘I’m hungry,’ she said. ‘Let’s make some more coffee.
    Damn! The stove’s gone out and the water’s cold.’ She picked
    the stove up and shook it. ‘There’s no oil in it.’
</p>

<p>
    ‘We can get some from old Charrington, I expect.’
</p>

<p>
    ‘The funny thing is I made sure it was full.<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">笔记：我觉得，这里是一个伏笔，它可能预示着“有人动过手脚了”</sub> I’m going to
    put my clothes on,’ she added. ‘It seems to have got colder.’
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>

<p>
    Winston also got up and dressed himself. The indefatigable voice sang on:
</p>

<pre>
    <i>
    ‘They sye that time ‘eals all things,
    They sye you can always forget;
    But the smiles an’ the tears acrorss the years

    As he fastened the belt of his overalls he strolled across
    to the window. The sun must have gone down behind the
    houses; it was not shining into the yard any longer. The flagstones
    were wet as though they had just been washed, and
    he had the feeling that the sky had been washed too, so fresh
    and pale was the blue between the chimney-pots. Tirelessly the
    woman marched to and fro, corking and uncorking
    herself, singing and falling silent, and pegging out more diapers,
    and more and yet more. He wondered whether she
    took in washing for a living or was merely the slave of twenty
    or thirty grandchildren. Julia had come across to his side;
    together they gazed down with a sort of fascination at the
    sturdy<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">强壮的；健壮的 physically strong and healthy</sub> figure below. As he looked at the woman in her characteristic
    attitude, her thick arms reaching up for the line,
    her powerful mare-like buttocks<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">屁股的一边；臀部 either of the two round soft parts at the top of a person's legs</sub> protruded<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">突出；伸出；鼓出 to stick out from a place or a surface</sub>, it struck him
    for the first time that she was beautiful. It had never before
    occurred to him that the body of a woman of fifty, blown up
    to monstrous dimensions by childbearing<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">分娩；生孩子 the process of giving birth to children</sub>, then hardened,
    roughened by work till it was coarse in the grain like an
    over-ripe turnip<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">蔓菁；芜菁；白萝卜；大头菜 a round white, or white and purple, root vegetable</sub>, could be beautiful. But it was so, and after
    all, he thought, why not? The solid, contourless body, like a
    block of granite, and the rasping red skin, bore the same relation
    to the body of a girl as the rose-hip<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">玫瑰果</sub> to the rose. Why
    should the fruit be held inferior to the flower?
</p>

<p>
    ‘She’s beautiful,’ he murmured.
</p>

<p>
    ‘She’s a metre across the hips, easily,’ said Julia.
</p>

<p>
    ‘That is her style of beauty,’ said Winston.
</p>

<p>
    He held Julia’s supple<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（身体）柔软的，灵活的；柔韧性好的 able to bend and move parts of your body easily into different positions</sub> waist easily encircled by his arm.
    From the hip to the knee her flank<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（建筑物、山等的）侧面 the side of sth such as a building or mountain</sub> was against his. Out of
    their bodies no child would ever come. That was the one
    thing they could never do. Only by word of mouth, from
    mind to mind, could they pass on the secret. The woman
    down there had no mind, she had only strong arms, a warm
    heart, and a fertile belly. He wondered how many children
    she had given birth to. It might easily be fifteen. She had
    had her momentary flowering, a year, perhaps, of wild-rose
    beauty and then she had suddenly swollen like a fertilized
    fruit and grown hard and red and coarse, and then her life
    had been laundering, scrubbing, darning, cooking, sweeping,
    polishing, mending, scrubbing, laundering, first for
    children, then for grandchildren, over thirty unbroken
    years. At the end of it she was still singing. The mystical
    reverence that he felt for her was somehow mixed up with
    the aspect of the pale, cloudless sky, stretching away behind
    the chimney-pots into interminable distance. It was curious
    to think that the sky was the same for everybody, in
    Eurasia or Eastasia as well as here. And the people under
    the sky were also very much the same—everywhere, all over
    the world, hundreds of thousands of millions of people just
    like this, people ignorant of one another’s existence, held
    apart by walls of hatred and lies, and yet almost exactly the
    same—people who had never learned to think but who were
    storing up in their hearts and bellies and muscles the power
    that would one day overturn the world. If there was hope,
    it lay in the proles! Without having read to the end of THE
    BOOK, he knew that that must be Goldstein’s final message.
    The future belonged to the proles. And could he be sure that
    when their time came the world they constructed would not
    be just as alien to him, Winston Smith, as the world of the
    Party? Yes, because at the least it would be a world of sanity.
    Where there is equality there can be sanity. Sooner or later
    it would happen, strength would change into consciousness.
    The proles were immortal, you could not doubt it when you
    looked at that valiant<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">英勇的；勇敢的；果敢的；坚定的 very brave or determined</sub> figure in the yard. In the end their
    awakening would come. And until that happened, though it
    might be a thousand years, they would stay alive against all
    the odds, like birds, passing on from body to body the vitality
    which the Party did not share and could not kill.

    ‘Do you remember,’ he said, ‘the thrush<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">画眉鸟</sub> that sang to us,

    ‘He wasn’t singing to us,’ said Julia. ‘He was singing to
    please himself. Not even that. He was just singing.’
</p>

<p>
    The birds sang, the proles sang. the Party did not sing.
    All round the world, in London and New York, in Africa
    and Brazil, and in the mysterious, forbidden lands beyond
    the frontiers, in the streets of Paris and Berlin, in the villages
    of the endless Russian plain, in the bazaars of China and
    Japan—everywhere stood the same solid unconquerable
    figure, made monstrous<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">巨大的；丑陋的；骇人的 very large, ugly and frightening</sub> by work and childbearing, toiling<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（长时间）苦干，辛勤劳作 to work very hard and/or for a long time, usually doing hard physical work</sub>
    from birth to death and still singing. Out of those mighty

    were the dead, theirs was the future. But you could share in
    that future if you kept alive the mind as they kept alive the

    make four.

    They sprang apart. Winston’s entrails<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">内脏；（尤指）肠 the organs inside the body of a person or an animal, especially their intestines</sub> seemed to have
    turned into ice. He could see the white all round the irises of
    Julia’s eyes. Her face had turned a milky yellow. The smear<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">污迹；污渍；污点 an oily or dirty mark</sub>
    of rouge<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">胭脂 a red powder used by women for giving colour to their cheeks</sub> that was still on each cheekbone stood out sharply,
    almost as though unconnected with the skin beneath.

    ‘You are the dead,’ repeated the iron voice.

</p>

<p>
    ‘It was behind the picture,’ said the voice. ‘Remain exactly
    where you are. Make no movement until you are ordered.’
</p>

<p>
    It was starting, it was starting at last! They could do nothing
    except stand gazing into one another’s eyes. To run for
    life, to get out of the house before it was too late—no such
    thought occurred to them. Unthinkable to disobey the iron
    voice from the wall. There was a snap<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（尤指关上或断裂的声音）啪嗒声，咔嚓声a sudden sharp noise, especially one made by sth closing or breaking</sub> as though a catch had
    been turned back, and a crash of breaking glass. The picture

    ‘Now they can see us,’ said Julia.
</p>

<p>
    ‘Now we can see you,’ said the voice. ‘Stand out in the
    middle of the room. Stand back to back. Clasp your hands
    behind your heads. Do not touch one another.’
</p>

<p>
    They were not touching, but it seemed to him that he
    could feel Julia’s body shaking. Or perhaps it was merely
    the shaking of his own. He could just stop his teeth from
    chattering<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（因冷或害怕）打颤to knock together continuously because you are cold or frightened</sub>, but his knees were beyond his control. There
    was a sound of trampling<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">踩碎；踩伤；践踏 to step heavily on sb/sth so that you crush or harm them/it with your feet</sub> boots below, inside the house and
    outside. The yard seemed to be full of men. Something was
    being dragged across the stones. The woman’s singing had
    stopped abruptly. There was a long, rolling clang<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">铿锵(声)</sub>, as though
    the washtub<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（旧时的）洗衣盆(in the past) a large metal container for washing clothes, etc. in</sub> had been flung across the yard, and then a confusion<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（让人不知所措的）混乱局面，乱成一团 a confused situation in which people do not know what action to take</sub>

    ‘The house is surrounded,’ said Winston.
</p>

<p>
    ‘The house is surrounded,’ said the voice.

    He heard Julia snap her teeth together. ‘I suppose we may
    as well say good-bye,’ she said.

<p>
    ‘You may as well say good-bye,’ said the voice. And then
    another quite different voice, a thin, cultivated voice which
    Winston had the impression of having heard before, struck
    in; ‘And by the way, while we are on the subject, ‘Here comes
    a candle to light you to bed, here comes a chopper to chop
    off your head’!’
</p>

<p>
    Something crashed on to the bed behind Winston’s back.
    The head of a ladder had been thrust through the window
    and had burst in the frame. Someone was climbing through
    the window. There was a stampede<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（人群的）奔逃，蜂拥；（兽群的）惊跑，狂奔 a situation in which a group of people or large animals such as horses suddenly start running in the same direction, especially because they are frightened or excited</sub> of boots up the stairs.
    The room was full of solid men in black uniforms, with iron-shod
    boots on their feet and truncheons<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">警棍 a short thick stick that police officers carry as a weapon</sub> in their hands.

    Winston was not trembling any longer. Even his eyes he
    barely moved. One thing alone mattered; to keep still, to
    keep still and not give them an excuse to hit you! A man
    with a smooth prize-fighter’s jowl<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">双下巴；下颌垂肉 the lower part of sb's cheek when it is fat and hangs down below their chin</sub> in which the mouth was
    only a slit paused opposite him balancing his truncheon
    meditatively between thumb and forefinger. Winston met
    his eyes. The feeling of nakedness, with one’s hands behind
    one’s head and one’s face and body all exposed, was almost
    unbearable. The man protruded the tip of a white tongue,
    licked the place where his lips should have been, and then
    passed on. There was another crash. Someone had picked
    up the glass paperweight from the table and smashed it to
    pieces on the hearth-stone.

    The fragment of coral, a tiny crinkle<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">褶痕；皱纹 a very thin fold or line made on paper, cloth or skin</sub> of pink like a sugar
    rosebud<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">玫瑰花蕾 the flower of a rose before it is open</sub> from a cake, rolled across the mat. How small,
    thought Winston, how small it always was! There was a gasp<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（常指由强烈情感引起的）深吸气，喘息，倒抽气a quick deep breath, usually caused by a strong emotion</sub>
    and a thump<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">
    重击；捶击an act of hitting sb/sth hard</sub> behind him, and he received a violent kick on
    the ankle which nearly flung him off his balance. One of the
    men had smashed<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">猛击 to hit sth/sb very hard</sub> his fist into Julia’s solar plexus<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">心口 the part of the body at the top of the stomach, below the ribs</sub>, doubling
    her up like a pocket ruler<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">折尺</sub>. She was thrashing<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">激烈扭动，翻来覆去 to move or make sth move in a violent or uncontrolled way</sub> about on the
    floor, fighting for breath. Winston dared not turn his head
    even by a millimetre, but sometimes her livid<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">乌青色的；青灰色的 dark bluish-grey in colour</sub>, gasping<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">气喘的</sub> face
    came within the angle of his vision. Even in his terror it was
    as though he could feel the pain in his own body, the deadly
    pain which nevertheless was less urgent than the struggle to
    get back her breath. He knew what it was like; the terrible,
    agonizing pain which was there all the while but could not
    be suffered yet, because before all else it was necessary to
    be able to breathe. Then two of the men hoisted<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">吊起；提升；拉高 to raise or pull sth up to a higher position, often using ropes or special equipment</sub> her up by
    knees and shoulders, and carried her out of the room like a
    sack<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">麻布（或厚纸、塑料等）大袋 a large bag with no handles, made of strong rough material or strong paper or plastic, used for storing and carrying, for example flour, coal, etc.</sub>. Winston had a glimpse of her face, upside down, yellow
    and contorted, with the eyes shut, and still with a smear
    of rouge on either cheek; and that was the last he saw of her.

    He stood dead still. No one had hit him yet. Thoughts
    which came of their own accord but seemed totally uninteresting<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">不吸引人的；无趣的；无聊的not attracting your attention or interest; not interesting</sub>
    began to flit through his mind. He wondered whether
    they had got Mr Charrington. He wondered what they had
    done to the woman in the yard. He noticed that he badly
    wanted to urinate<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">排尿；小便 to get rid of urine from the body</sub>, and felt a faint<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">微小的</sub> surprise, because he
    had done so only two or three hours ago. He noticed that
    the clock on the mantelpiece said nine, meaning twenty-one.
    But the light seemed too strong. Would not the light
    be fading at twenty-one hours on an August evening? He
    wondered whether after all he and Julia had mistaken the
    time—had slept the clock round and thought it was twenty-thirty
    when really it was nought eight-thirty on the
    following morning. But he did not pursue the thought further. It was not interesting.

    There ws another, lighter step in the passage. Mr
    Charrington came into the room. The demeanour<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">外表；风度；行为；举止 the way that sb looks or behaves</sub> of
    the black-uniformed men suddenly became more subdued<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">闷闷不乐的；抑郁的；默不作声的unusually quiet, and possibly unhappy</sub>.
    Something had also changed in Mr Charrington’s
    appearance. His eye fell on the fragments of the glass paperweight.

<p>
    ‘Pick up those pieces,’ he said sharply.
</p>

<p>
    A man stooped<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">俯身；弯腰 to bend your body forwards and downwards</sub> to obey. The cockney<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">伦敦东区的口音（或土腔）the way of speaking that is typical of cockneys</sub> accent had disappeared;
    Winston suddenly realized whose voice it was that
    he had heard a few moments ago on the telescreen. Mr Charrington
    was still wearing his old velvet<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">丝绒；立绒；经绒；天鹅绒 a type of cloth made from silk, cotton or nylon , with a thick soft surface</sub> jacket, but his hair,
    which had been almost white, had turned black. Also he was
    not wearing his spectacles. He gave Winston a single sharp
    glance, as though verifying his identity, and then paid no
    more attention to him. He was still recognizable, but he was
    not the same person any longer. His body had straightened,
    and seemed to have grown bigger. His face had undergone
    only tiny changes that had nevertheless worked a complete
    transformation. The black eyebrows were less bushy, the
    wrinkles were gone, the whole lines of the face seemed to
    have altered; even the nose seemed shorter. It was the alert,
    cold face of a man of about five-and-thirty. It occurred to
    Winston that for the first time in his life he was looking,
    with knowledge, at a member of the Thought Police.
