    Winston was gelatinous<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">凝胶状的 thick and sticky, like a jelly</sub> with fatigue. Gelatinous was
    the right word. It had come into his head spontaneously.
    His body seemed to have not only the weakness of a
    jelly, but its translucency. He felt that if he held up his hand
    he would be able to see the light through it. All the blood
    and lymph<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">淋巴 a clear liquid containing white blood cells that helps to clean the tissues of the body and helps to prevent infections from spreading</sub> had been drained out of him by an enormous
    debauch of work, leaving only a frail structure of nerves,
    bones, and skin. All sensations seemed to be magnified. His
    overalls fretted his shoulders, the pavement tickled his feet,
    even the opening and closing of a hand was an effort that
    made his joints creak<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">嘎吱作响（开门或踩上木地板等时发出的声音）to make the sound that a door sometimes makes when you open it or that a wooden floor sometimes makes when you step on it</sub>.

    He had worked more than ninety hours in five days. So
    had everyone else in the Ministry. Now it was all over, and
    he had literally nothing to do, no Party work of any description,
    until tomorrow morning. He could spend six hours in
    the hiding-place and another nine in his own bed. Slowly, in
    mild afternoon sunshine, he walked up a dingy street in the
    direction of Mr Charrington’s shop, keeping one eye open
    for the patrols, but irrationally convinced that this afternoon
    there was no danger of anyone interfering with him.
    The heavy brief-case that he was carrying bumped against
    his knee at each step, sending a tingling sensation up and
    down the skin of his leg. Inside it was the book, which he
    had now had in his possession for six days and had not yet
    opened, nor even looked at.

    On the sixth day of Hate Week, after the processions, the
    speeches, the shouting, the singing, the banners, the posters,
    the films, the waxworks, the rolling of drums and squealing
    of trumpets, the tramp of marching feet, the grinding
    of the caterpillars of tanks, the roar of massed planes, the
    booming of guns—after six days of this, when the great orgasm
    was quivering to its climax and the general hatred of
    Eurasia had boiled up into such delirium that if the crowd
    could have got their hands on the 2,000 Eurasian war-criminals
    who were to be publicly hanged on the last day of the
    proceedings, they would unquestionably have torn them
    to pieces—at just this moment it had been announced that
    Oceania was not after all at war with Eurasia. Oceania was
    at war with Eastasia. Eurasia was an ally.

    There was, of course, no admission<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（尤指对过错、罪行的）承认，招认，招供a statement in which sb admits that sth is true, especially sth wrong or bad that they have done</sub> that any change had
    taken place. Merely it became known, with extreme suddenness
    and everywhere at once, that Eastasia and not
    Eurasia was the enemy. Winston was taking part in a demonstration
    in one of the central London squares at the
    moment when it happened. It was night, and the white faces
    and the scarlet banners were luridly<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">绚丽地；色彩斑斓地</sub> floodlit<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">泛光灯，泛光照明灯（运动场、舞台和建筑物外墙等用）a large powerful lamp, used for lighting sports grounds, theatre stages and the outside of buildings</sub>. The square
    was packed<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">塞进；挤进to fill sth with a lot of people or things</sub> with several thousand people, including a block
    of about a thousand schoolchildren in the uniform of the
    Spies. On a scarlet-draped platform an orator<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">讲演者；雄辩家；善于演说的人a person who makes formal speeches in public or is good at public speaking</sub> of the Inner
    Party, a small lean man with disproportionately long arms
    and a large bald skull over which a few lank locks straggled,
    was haranguing<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">呵斥；大声谴责；慷慨激昂地劝说to speak loudly and angrily in a way that criticizes sb/sth or tries to persuade people to do sth</sub> the crowd. A little Rumpelstiltskin<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">侏儒怪</sub>
    figure, contorted with hatred, he gripped the neck of the
    microphone with one hand while the other, enormous at
    the end of a bony<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">瘦骨嶙峋的very thin so that the bones can be seen under the skin</sub> arm, clawed the air menacingly<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">险恶；威胁地</sub> above his
    head. His voice, made metallic<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">金属般的；有金属味（或声音）的that looks, tastes or sounds like metal</sub> by the amplifiers<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">放大器；扩音器；扬声器 an electrical device or piece of equipment that makes sounds or radio signals louder</sub>, boomed<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">以低沉有力的声音说话to say sth in a loud deep voice</sub>
    forth an endless catalogue of atrocities<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（尤指战争中的）残暴行为a cruel and violent act, especially in a war</sub>, massacres, deportations<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">驱逐出境</sub>,
    lootings<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">掠夺；洗劫</sub>, rapings, torture of prisoners, bombing
    of civilians, lying propaganda, unjust aggressions, broken
    treaties. It was almost impossible to listen to him without
    being first convinced and then maddened. At every few moments
    the fury<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">狂怒；暴怒a state of being extremely angry about sth</sub> of the crowd boiled over and the voice of the
    speaker was drowned by a wild beast-like roaring that rose
    uncontrollably from thousands of throats. <strong>The most savage
    yells of all came from the schoolchildren.</strong> The speech
    had been proceeding for perhaps twenty minutes when a
    messenger hurried on to the platform and a scrap of paper
    was slipped into the speaker’s hand. He unrolled and read it
    without pausing in his speech. Nothing altered in his voice
    or manner, or in the content of what he was saying, but suddenly
    the names were different. Without words said, a wave
    of understanding rippled through the crowd. Oceania was
    at war with Eastasia! The next moment there was a tremendous
    commotion. The banners and posters with which the
    square was decorated were all wrong! Quite half of them
    had the wrong faces on them. It was sabotage<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（为防止敌人利用或表示抗议而对设备、交通等进行的）蓄意毁坏，人为破坏the act of doing deliberate damage to equipment, transport, machines, etc. to prevent an enemy from using them, or to protest about sth</sub>! The agents of
    Goldstein had been at work! There was a riotous interlude
    while posters were ripped from the walls, banners torn to
    shreds<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（撕或切的）细条</sub> and trampled underfoot. The Spies performed prodigies<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（年轻的）天才，奇才，精英；神童a young person who is unusually intelligent or skillful for their age</sub>
    of activity in clambering<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（吃力地）攀登，攀爬to climb or move with difficulty or a lot of effort, using your hands and feet</sub> over the rooftops and cutting
    the streamers<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">条幅；横幅a long narrow piece of cloth or other material</sub> that fluttered from the chimneys. But within
    two or three minutes it was all over. The orator, still gripping
    the neck of the microphone, his shoulders hunched<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">弓身；弓背；耸肩to bend the top part of your body forward and raise your shoulders and back</sub> forward,
    his free hand clawing at the air, had gone straight on with
    his speech. One minute more, and the feral<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">凶猛的</sub> roars of rage
    were again bursting from the crowd. The Hate continued
    exactly as before, except that the target had been changed.

    The thing that impressed Winston in looking back was
    that the speaker had switched from one line to the other actually
    in midsentence, not only without a pause, but without
    even breaking the syntax. But at the moment he had other
    things to preoccupy him. It was during the moment of disorder
    while the posters were being torn down that a man
    whose face he did not see had tapped him on the shoulder
    and said, ‘Excuse me, I think you’ve dropped your briefcase.’
    He took the brief-case abstractedly<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">心不在焉地</sub>, without speaking.
    He knew that it would be days before he had an opportunity
    to look inside it. The instant that the demonstration was
    over he went straight to the Ministry of Truth, though the
    time was now nearly twenty-three hours. The entire staff
    of the Ministry had done likewise. The orders already issuing
    from the telescreen, recalling them to their posts, were
    hardly necessary.

    Oceania was at war with Eastasia: Oceania had always
    been at war with Eastasia. A large part of the political literature
    of five years was now completely obsolete. Reports
    and records of all kinds, newspapers, books, pamphlets,
    films, sound-tracks, photographs—all had to be rectified
    at lightning speed. Although no directive was ever issued,
    it was known that the chiefs of the Department intended
    that within one week no reference to the war with Eurasia,
    or the alliance with Eastasia, should remain in existence
    anywhere. The work was overwhelming, all the more so
    because the processes that it involved could not be called
    by their true names. Everyone in the Records Department
    worked eighteen hours in the twenty-four, with two three-hour
    snatches of sleep. Mattresses<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">床垫the soft part of a bed, that you lie on</sub> were brought up from
    the cellars and pitched all over the corridors: meals consisted
    of sandwiches and Victory Coffee wheeled round
    on trolleys<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">手推车；手拉车 a small vehicle with wheels that can be pushed or pulled along and is used for carrying things</sub> by attendants from the canteen. Each time that
    Winston broke off for one of his spells of sleep he tried to
    leave his desk clear of work, and each time that he crawled
    back sticky-eyed and aching, it was to find that another
    shower<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">一大批；一阵；一连串 a large number of things that arrive or fall together</sub> of paper cylinders had covered the desk like a snowdrift<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（风吹成的）雪堆 a deep pile of snow that has been blown together by the wind</sub>,
    halfburying the speakwrite and overflowing on to the
    floor, so that the first job was always to stack them into a
    neat enough pile to give him room to work. What was worst
    of all was that the work was by no means purely mechanical.
    Often it was enough merely to substitute one name for another,
    but any detailed report of events demanded care and
    imagination. Even the geographical knowledge that one
    needed in transferring the war from one part of the world
    to another was considerable<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">相当多（或大、重要等）的great in amount, size, importance, etc.</sub>.
