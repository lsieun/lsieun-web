    They had done it, they had done it at last!

    The room they were standing in was long-shaped and
    softly lit. The telescreen was dimmed to a low murmur; the
    richness of the dark-blue carpet gave one the impression of
    treading on velvet<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">丝绒；立绒；经绒；天鹅绒 a type of cloth made from silk, cotton or nylon , with a thick soft surface</sub>. At the far end of the room O’Brien was
    sitting at a table under a green-shaded lamp, with a mass of
    papers on either side of him. He had not bothered to look up
    when the servant showed Julia and Winston in.

    Winston’s heart was thumping so hard that he doubted
    whether he would be able to speak. They had done it, they
    had done it at last, was all he could think. It had been a rash
    act to come here at all, and sheer folly to arrive together;
    though it was true that they had come by different routes
    and only met on O’Brien’s doorstep. But merely to walk into
    such a place needed an effort of the nerve. It was only on
    very rare occasions that one saw inside the dwelling-places
    of the Inner Party, or even penetrated into the quarter
    of the town where they lived. The whole atmosphere of the
    huge block of flats, the richness and spaciousness of everything,
    the unfamiliar smells of good food and good tobacco,
    the silent and incredibly rapid lifts sliding up and down, the
    white-jacketed servants hurrying to and fro—everything
    was intimidating. Although he had a good pretext for coming
    here, he was haunted<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">心神不宁 showing that sb is very worried</sub> at every step by the fear that a
    black-uniformed guard would suddenly appear from round
    the corner, demand his papers, and order him to get out.
    O’Brien’s servant, however, had admitted the two of them
    without demur<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">表示反对；提出异议；拒绝 to say that you do not agree with sth or that you refuse to do sth</sub>. He was a small, dark-haired man in a white
    jacket, with a diamond-shaped, completely expressionless
    face which might have been that of a Chinese. The passage
    down which he led them was softly carpeted, with cream-papered
    walls and white wainscoting<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">装有护壁板的墙壁</sub>, all exquisitely<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">精致地</sub> clean.
    That too was intimidating. Winston could not remember
    ever to have seen a passageway whose walls were not grimy<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">沾满污垢的；满是灰尘的covered with dirt</sub>
    from the contact of human bodies.
