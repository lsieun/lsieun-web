    He did not know where he was. Presumably<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">很可能；大概；想必是 used to say that you think that sth is probably true</sub> he was in
    the Ministry of Love, but there was no way of making certain.
    He was in a high-ceilinged windowless cell with
    walls of glittering white porcelain<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">白瓷</sub>. Concealed lamps flooded
    it with cold light, and there was a low, steady humming
    sound which he supposed had something to do with the
    air supply. A bench, or shelf, just wide enough to sit on ran
    round the wall, broken only by the door and, at the end opposite
    the door, a lavatory pan<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">大便器</sub> with no wooden seat. There
    were four telescreens, one in each wall.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    There was a dull aching in his belly. It had been there
    ever since they had bundled him into the closed van and
    driven him away. But he was also hungry, with a gnawing,
    unwholesome kind of hunger. It might be twenty-four
    hours since he had eaten, it might be thirty-six. He still did
    not know, probably never would know, whether it had been
    morning or evening when they arrested him. Since he was
    arrested he had not been fed.
</p>

<p>
    He sat as still as he could on the narrow bench, with his
    hands crossed on his knee. He had already learned to sit
    still. If you made unexpected movements they yelled at you
    from the telescreen. But the craving for food was growing
    upon him. What he longed for above all was a piece of bread.
    He had an idea that there were a few breadcrumbs in the
    pocket of his overalls. It was even possible—he thought this
    because from time to time something seemed to tickle his
    leg—that there might be a sizeable bit of crust there. In the
    end the temptation to find out overcame his fear; he slipped
    a hand into his pocket.
</p>

<p>
    ‘Smith!’ yelled a voice from the telescreen. ‘6079 Smith
    W.! Hands out of pockets in the cells!’
</p>

<p>
    He sat still again, his hands crossed on his knee. Before
    being brought here he had been taken to another place
    which must have been an ordinary prison or a temporary
    lock-up used by the patrols. He did not know how long he
    had been there; some hours at any rate; with no clocks and
    no daylight it was hard to gauge the time. It was a noisy, evil-smelling
    place. They had put him into a cell similar to the
    one he was now in, but filthily dirty and at all times crowded
    by ten or fifteen people. The majority of them were common
    criminals, but there were a few political prisoners among
    them. He had sat silent against the wall, jostled<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（在人群中）挤，推，撞，搡 to push roughly against sb in a crowd</sub> by dirty
    bodies, too preoccupied by fear and the pain in his belly to
    take much interest in his surroundings, but still noticing
    the astonishing difference in demeanour between the Party
    prisoners and the others. The Party prisoners were always
    silent and terrified, but the ordinary criminals seemed to
    care nothing for anybody. They yelled insults at the guards,
    fought back fiercely when their belongings were impounded<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">没收；扣押 to take sth away from sb, so that they cannot use it</sub>,
    wrote obscene<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">淫秽的；猥亵的；下流的 connected with sex in a way that most people find offensive</sub> words on the floor, ate smuggled food
    which they produced from mysterious hiding-places in their
    clothes, and even shouted down the telescreen when it tried
    to restore order. On the other hand some of them seemed
    to be on good terms with the guards, called them by nicknames,
    and tried to wheedle<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（用言语）哄 to persuade sb to give you sth or do sth by saying nice things that you do not mean</sub> cigarettes through the spyhole<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（门上的）观察孔，猫眼儿a small hole in a door that you can look through to see who is on the other side before opening the door</sub>
    in the door. The guards, too, treated the common criminals
    with a certain forbearance<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">宽容 the quality of being patient and sympathetic towards other people, especially when they have done sth wrong</sub>, even when they had to handle
    them roughly. There was much talk about the forced-labour
    camps to which most of the prisoners expected to be sent.
    It was ‘all right’ in the camps, he gathered, so long as you
    had good contacts and knew the ropes. There was bribery<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">行贿；受贿；贿赂 the giving or taking of bribes</sub>,
    favouritism<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">偏爱；偏袒 the act of unfairly treating one person better than others because you like them better</sub>, and racketeering<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">敲诈勒索</sub> of every kind, there was homosexuality
    and prostitution<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">卖淫；为娼；当男妓 the work of a prostitute</sub>, there was even illicit<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">非法的；违法的 not allowed by the law</sub> alcohol
    distilled from potatoes. The positions of trust were given
    only to the common criminals, especially the gangsters<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">匪徒；歹徒；土匪 a member of a group of violent criminals</sub> and
    the murderers, who formed a sort of aristocracy<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（某些国家的）贵族(in some countries) people born in the highest social class, who have special titles</sub>. All the
    dirty jobs were done by the politicals.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    There was a constant come-and-go of prisoners of every
    description: drug-peddlers<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">毒品贩子 a person who sells illegal drugs</sub>, thieves, bandits, black-marketeers,
    drunks, prostitutes. Some of the drunks were so
    violent that the other prisoners had to combine to suppress them.
    An enormous wreck<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（身体或精神上）受到严重损伤的人 a person who is in a bad physical or mental condition</sub> of a woman, aged about
    sixty, with great tumbling breasts and thick coils of white
    hair which had come down in her struggles, was carried in,
    kicking and shouting, by four guards, who had hold of her
    one at each corner. They wrenched<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">猛拉；猛扭；猛拧to pull or twist sth/sb/yourself suddenly and violently</sub> off the boots with which
    she had been trying to kick them, and dumped<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（尤指在不合适的地方）丢弃，扔掉，倾倒to get rid of sth you do not want, especially in a place which is not suitable</sub> her down
    across Winston’s lap, almost breaking his thigh-bones<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">股骨；大腿骨</sub>. The
    woman hoisted herself upright and followed them out with
    a yell of ‘F—— bastards!’ Then, noticing that she was sitting
    on something uneven, she slid off Winston’s knees on
    to the bench.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    ‘Beg pardon, dearie,’ she said. ‘I wouldn’t ‘a sat on you,
    only the buggers put me there. They dono ‘ow to treat a lady,
    do they?’ She paused, patted her breast, and belched<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（大量）喷出，吐出to send out large amounts of smoke, flames, etc.; to come out of sth in large amounts</sub>. ‘Pardon,’
    she said, ‘I ain’t meself, quite.’
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    She leant forward and vomited<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">呕；吐；呕吐to bring food from the stomach back out through the mouth</sub> copiously<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">大量的；充裕的；丰富的 in large amounts</sub> on the floor.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    ‘Thass<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">that's</sub> better,’ she said, leaning back with closed eyes.
    ‘Never keep it down, thass<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">that's</sub> what I say. Get it up while it’s
    fresh on your stomach, like.’
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    She revived, turned to have another look at Winston and
    seemed immediately to take a fancy to him. She put a vast
    arm round his shoulder and drew him towards her, breathing
    beer and vomit into his face.
</p>

<p>
    ‘Wass your name, dearie?’ she said.
</p>

<p>
    ‘Smith,’ said Winston.
</p>

<p>
    ‘Smith?’ said the woman. ‘Thass funny. My name’s Smith
    too. Why,’ she added sentimentally, ‘I might be your mother!’
</p>

<p>
    She might, thought Winston, be his mother. She was
    about the right age and physique<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">体格；体形 the size and shape of a person's body</sub>, and it was probable that
    people changed somewhat after twenty years in a forced-labour camp.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    No one else had spoken to him. To a surprising extent
    the ordinary criminals ignored the Party prisoners. ‘The
    polITS<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">police</sub>,’ they called them, with a sort of uninterested contempt.
    The Party prisoners seemed terrified of speaking to
    anybody, and above all of speaking to one another. Only
    once, when two Party members, both women, were pressed
    close together on the bench, he overheard amid the din of
    voices a few hurriedly-whispered words; and in particular a
    reference to something called ‘room one-oh-one’, which he
    did not understand.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    It might be two or three hours ago that they had brought
    him here. The dull pain in his belly never went away, but
    sometimes it grew better and sometimes worse, and his
    thoughts expanded or contracted accordingly. When it
    grew worse he thought only of the pain itself, and of his desire
    for food. When it grew better, panic took hold of him.
    There were moments when he foresaw the things that would
    happen to him with such actuality<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">真实情况；现实情况；事实 things that exist</sub> that his heart galloped<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">飞跑；奔跑 to run very quickly</sub>
    and his breath stopped. He felt the smash<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">猛烈撞击，猛烈碰撞 to move with a lot of force against sth solid; to make sth do this</sub> of truncheons<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">警棍 a short thick stick that police officers carry as a weapon</sub> on
    his elbows and iron-shod boots on his shins<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">胫；胫部 the front part of the leg below the knee</sub>; he saw himself
    grovelling<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">卑躬屈膝；俯首贴耳；奴颜婢膝 to behave in a very humble way towards sb who is more important than you or who can give you sth you want</sub> on the floor, screaming for mercy through broken
    teeth. He hardly thought of Julia. He could not fix his
    mind on her. He loved her and would not betray her; but
    that was only a fact, known as he knew the rules of arithmetic.
    He felt no love for her, and he hardly even wondered
    what was happening to her. He thought oftener of O’Brien,
    with a flickering<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">忽隐忽现的</sub> hope. O’Brien might know that he had
    been arrested. The Brotherhood, he had said, never tried to
    save its members. But there was the razor blade; they would
    send the razor blade if they could. There would be perhaps
    five seconds before the guard could rush into the cell. The
    blade would bite into him with a sort of burning coldness,
    and even the fingers that held it would be cut to the bone.
    Everything came back to his sick body, which shrank trembling
    from the smallest pain. He was not certain that he
    would use the razor blade even if he got the chance. It was
    more natural to exist from moment to moment, accepting
    another ten minutes’ life even with the certainty that there
    was torture at the end of it.
    <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：我觉得，这最后几句可能表达的就是，只要活下去，就可能有希望。</sub>
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    Sometimes he tried to calculate the number of porcelain
    bricks in the walls of the cell. It should have been easy, but
    he always lost count at some point or another. More often he
    wondered where he was, and what time of day it was. At one
    moment he felt certain that it was broad daylight outside,
    and at the next equally certain that it was pitch darkness. In
    this place, he knew instinctively, the lights would never be
    turned out. It was the place with no darkness: he saw now
    why O’Brien had seemed to recognize the allusion<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">暗指；引喻；典故 something that is said or written that refers to or mentions another person or subject in an indirect way(= alludes to it)</sub>. In the
    Ministry of Love there were no windows. His cell might be
    at the heart of the building or against its outer wall; it might
    be ten floors below ground, or thirty above it. He moved
    himself mentally from place to place, and tried to determine
    by the feeling of his body whether he was perched
    high in the air or buried deep underground.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    There was a sound of marching boots outside. The steel
    door opened with a clang<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">叮当作响，铿锵作响 to make a loud ringing sound like that of metal being hit</sub>. A young officer, a trim black-uniformed
    figure who seemed to glitter all over with polished
    leather, and whose pale, straight-featured face was like a
    wax mask, stepped smartly through the doorway. He motioned
    to the guards outside to bring in the prisoner they
    were leading. The poet Ampleforth shambled<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">拖着脚走；蹒跚 to walk in an awkward or lazy way, dragging your feet along the ground</sub> into the cell.
    The door clanged shut again.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    Ampleforth made one or two uncertain movements from
    side to side, as though having some idea that there was another
    door to go out of, and then began to wander up and
    down the cell. He had not yet noticed Winston’s presence.
    His troubled eyes were gazing at the wall about a metre
    above the level of Winston’s head. He was shoeless; large,
    dirty toes were sticking out of the holes in his socks. He
    was also several days away from a shave. A scrubby<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">长满灌木和矮树的；灌木丛生的 covered with small bushes and trees</sub> beard
    covered his face to the cheekbones, giving him an air of
    ruffianism<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">流氓习气</sub> that went oddly with his large weak frame and
    nervous movements.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    Winston roused hirnself a little from his lethargy<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">无精打采；没有热情；冷漠the state of not having any energy or enthusiasm for doing things</sub>. He
    must speak to Ampleforth, and risk the yell from the telescreen.
    It was even conceivable that Ampleforth was the
    bearer of the razor blade.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    ‘Ampleforth,’ he said.
</p>

<p>
    There was no yell from the telescreen. Ampleforth
    paused, mildly startled. His eyes focused themselves slowly
    on Winston.
</p>

<p>
    ‘Ah, Smith!’ he said. ‘You too!’
</p>

<p>
    ‘What are you in for?’
</p>

<p>
    ‘To tell you the truth—’ He sat down awkwardly on the
    bench opposite Winston. ‘There is only one offence, is there
    not?’ he said.
</p>

<p>
    ‘And have you committed it?’
</p>

<p>
    ‘Apparently I have.’
</p>

<p>
    He put a hand to his forehead and pressed his temples for
    a moment, as though trying to remember something.
</p>

<p>
    ‘These things happen,’ he began vaguely. ‘I have been
    able to recall one instance—a possible instance. It was an
    indiscretion<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">不慎的言行；（尤指道德上）不检点的言行an act or remark that is indiscreet , especially one that is not morally acceptable</sub>, undoubtedly. We were producing a definitive
    edition of the poems of Kipling. I allowed the word ‘God’ to
    remain at the end of a line. I could not help it!’ he added almost
    indignantly<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">愤慨地；生气地</sub>, raising his face to look at Winston. ‘It was
    impossible to change the line. The rhyme was ‘rod”. Do you
    realize that there are only twelve rhymes to ‘rod’ in the entire
    language? For days I had racked<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">使痛苦不堪；使受折磨</sub> my brains. There WAS
    no other rhyme.’
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    The expression on his face changed. The annoyance
    passed out of it and for a moment he looked almost pleased.
    A sort of intellectual warmth, the joy of the pedant who has
    found out some useless fact, shone through the dirt and
    scrubby hair.
</p>

<p>
    ‘Has it ever occurred to you,’ he said, ‘that the whole history
    of English poetry has been determined by the fact that
    the English language lacks rhymes?’
</p>

<p>
    No, that particular thought had never occurred to Winston.
    Nor, in the circumstances, did it strike him as very
    important or interesting.
</p>

<p>
    ‘Do you know what time of day it is?’ he said.
</p>

<p>
    Ampleforth looked startled again. ‘I had hardly thought
    about it. They arrested me—it could be two days ago—perhaps three.’
    His eyes flitted round the walls, as though he
    half expected to find a window somewhere. ‘There is no difference
    between night and day in this place. I do not see
    how one can calculate the time.’
</p>

<p>
    They talked desultorily<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">杂乱无章地；无系统地</sub> for some minutes, then, without
    apparent reason, a yell from the telescreen bade them be
    silent. Winston sat quietly, his hands crossed. Ampleforth,
    too large to sit in comfort on the narrow bench, fidgeted<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">坐立不安；烦躁 to keep moving your body, your hands or your feet because you are nervous, bored, excited, etc.</sub>
    from side to side, clasping his lank<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">平直而无光泽的 straight, dull and not attractive</sub> hands first round one
    knee, then round the other. The telescreen barked at him to
    keep still. Time passed. Twenty minutes, an hour—it was
    difficult to judge. Once more there was a sound of boots
    outside. Winston’s entrails contracted. Soon, very soon,
    perhaps in five minutes, perhaps now, the tramp<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">沉重的脚步声 the sound of sb's heavy steps</sub> of boots
    would mean that his own turn had come.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    The door opened. The cold-faced young officer stepped
    into the cell. With a brief movement of the hand he indicated Ampleforth.
</p>

<p>
    ‘Room 101,’ he said.
</p>

<p>
    Ampleforth marched clumsily out between the guards,
    his face vaguely perturbed<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">使焦虑；使不安 to make sb worried or anxious</sub>, but uncomprehending<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">不理解的；茫然的；不领会的 not understanding a situation or what is happening</sub>.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    What seemed like a long time passed. The pain in Winston’s
    belly had revived. His mind sagged<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">减弱；减少 to become weaker or fewer</sub> round and round
    on the same trick, like a ball falling again and again into
    the same series of slots. He had only six thoughts. The pain
    in his belly; a piece of bread; the blood and the screaming;
    O’Brien; Julia; the razor blade. There was another spasm<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">痉挛；抽搐 a sudden and often painful contracting of a muscle, which you cannot control</sub> in
    his entrails, the heavy boots were approaching. As the door
    opened, the wave of air that it created brought in a powerful
    smell of cold sweat. Parsons walked into the cell. He was
    wearing khaki shorts and a sports-shirt.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    This time Winston was startled into self-forgetfulness.
</p>

<p>
    ‘YOU here!’ he said.
</p>

<p>
    Parsons gave Winston a glance in which there was
    neither interest nor surprise, but only misery. He began
    walking jerkily<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">抽搐地</sub> up and down, evidently unable to keep still.
    Each time he straightened his pudgy<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">微胖的 slightly fat</sub> knees it was apparent
    that they were trembling. His eyes had a wide-open, staring
    look, as though he could not prevent himself from gazing at
    something in the middle distance.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    ‘What are you in for?’ said Winston.
</p>

<p>
    ‘Thoughtcrime!’ said Parsons, almost blubbering<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">〈非正式〉哭诉；边哭边说</sub>. The
    tone of his voice implied at once a complete admission of
    his guilt and a sort of incredulous horror that such a word
    could be applied to himself. He paused opposite Winston
    and began eagerly appealing to him: ‘You don’t think they’ll
    shoot me, do you, old chap? They don’t shoot you if you
    haven’t actually done anything—only thoughts, which you
    can’t help? I know they give you a fair<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（按法律、规定）平等待人的，秉公办事的，公正的treating everyone equally and according to the rules or law</sub> hearing. Oh, I trust
    them for that! They’ll know my record, won’t they? YOU
    know what kind of chap I was. Not a bad chap in my way.
    Not brainy, of course, but keen. I tried to do my best for the
    Party, didn’t I? I’ll get off with five years, don’t you think? Or
    even ten years? A chap like me could make himself pretty
    useful in a labour-camp. They wouldn’t shoot me for going
    off the rails just once?’
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    ‘Are you guilty?’ said Winston.
</p>

<p>
    ‘Of course I’m guilty!’ cried Parsons with a servile<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">奴性的；逢迎的；恭顺的wanting too much to please sb and obey them</sub> glance
    at the telescreen. ‘You don’t think the Party would arrest
    an innocent man, do you?’ His frog-like face grew calmer,
    and even took on a slightly sanctimonious<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">装作圣洁的；伪善的；道貌岸然的 giving the impression that you feel you are better and more moral than other people</sub> expression.
    ‘Thoughtcrime is a dreadful thing, old man,’ he said sententiously<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">简洁地</sub>.
    ‘It’s insidious. It can get hold of you without your
    even knowing it. Do you know how it got hold of me? In my
    sleep! Yes, that’s a fact. There I was, working away, trying to
    do my bit—never knew I had any bad stuff in my mind at all.
    And then I started talking in my sleep. Do you know what
    they heard me saying?’
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    He sank his voice, like someone who is obliged for medical reasons to utter an obscenity.
</p>

<p>
    ‘’Down with Big Brother!’ Yes, I said that! Said it over
    and over again, it seems. Between you and me, old man, I’m
    glad they got me before it went any further. Do you know
    what I’m going to say to them when I go up before the tribunal<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">特别法庭；裁判所 a type of court with the authority to deal with a particular problem or disagreement</sub>?
    ‘Thank you,’ I’m going to say, ‘thank you for saving me
    before it was too late.‘‘

<p>
    ‘Who denounced<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">告发（某人从事非法政治活动）to tell the police, the authorities, etc. about sb's illegal political activities</sub> you?’ said Winston.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    ‘It was my little daughter,’ said Parsons with a sort of
    doleful<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">忧郁的；悲伤的 very sad</sub> pride. ‘She listened at the keyhole. Heard what I
    was saying, and nipped off to the patrols the very next day.
    Pretty smart for a nipper<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">小孩子 a small child</sub> of seven, eh? I don’t bear her any
    grudge<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">积怨；怨恨；嫌隙 a feeling of anger or dislike towards sb because of sth bad they have done to you in the past</sub> for it. In fact I’m proud of her. It shows I brought her
    up in the right spirit, anyway.’
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    He made a few more jerky<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">忽动忽停的；颠簸的 making sudden starts and stops and not moving smoothly</sub> movements up and down,
    several times, casting a longing glance at the lavatory pan.
    Then he suddenly ripped down<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">扯下</sub> his shorts.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    ‘Excuse me, old man,’ he said. ‘I can’t help it. It’s the waiting.’
</p>

<p>
    He plumped his large posterior<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">臀部；屁股 the part of your body that you sit on; your bottom</sub> into the lavatory pan.
    Winston covered his face with his hands.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    ‘Smith!’ yelled the voice from the telescreen. ‘6079 Smith
    W! Uncover your face. No faces covered in the cells.’
</p>

<p>
    Winston uncovered his face. Parsons used the lavatory,
    loudly and abundantly. It then turned out that the plug<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">塞子 a thick round piece of plastic, rubber or metal that you put in the hole in a bath/ bathtub or a sink to stop the water flowing out</sub> was
    defective and the cell stank<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">有臭味；有难闻的气味 to have a strong, unpleasant smell</sub> abominably<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">令人憎恶的；令人厌恶的；极其讨厌的 extremely unpleasant and causing disgust</sub> for hours afterwards.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    Parsons was removed. More prisoners came and went,
    mysteriously. One, a woman, was consigned<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">交给；交付；寄送to give or send sth to sb</sub> to ‘Room 101’,
    and, Winston noticed, seemed to shrivel<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">枯萎，干枯，皱缩 to become or make sth dry and wrinkled as a result of heat, cold or being old</sub> and turn a different
    colour when she heard the words. A time came when, if
    it had been morning when he was brought here, it would be
    afternoon; or if it had been afternoon, then it would be midnight.
    There were six prisoners in the cell, men and women.
    All sat very still. Opposite Winston there sat a man with a
    chinless<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">下巴短小的（常被认为性格软弱）having a very small chin (often thought of as a sign of a weak character)</sub>, toothy<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（笑时）露齿的，多齿的 a toothy smile shows a lot of teeth</sub> face exactly like that of some large, harmless
    rodent<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">啮齿动物 any small animal that belongs to a group of animals with strong sharp front teeth. Mice, rats and squirrels are all rodents.</sub>. His fat, mottled<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">斑驳的；杂色的 marked with shapes of different colours without a regular pattern</sub> cheeks were so pouched<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">有袋的;袋形的;悬垂如袋的</sub> at the
    bottom that it was difficult not to believe that he had little
    stores of food tucked away there. His pale-grey eyes flitted
    timorously<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">羞怯的；胆怯的；畏怯的 nervous and easily frightened</sub> from face to face and turned quickly away again
    when he caught anyone’s eye.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    The door opened, and another prisoner was brought in
    whose appearance sent a momentary chill through Winston.
    He was a commonplace, mean-looking<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">形象猥琐；吓人的</sub> man who
    might have been an engineer or technician of some kind.
    But what was startling was the emaciation<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">异常消瘦</sub> of his face. It
    was like a skull. Because of its thinness the mouth and eyes
    looked disproportionately large, and the eyes seemed filled
    with a murderous, unappeasable hatred of somebody or
    something.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    The man sat down on the bench at a little distance from
    Winston. Winston did not look at him again, but the tormented,
    skull-like face was as vivid in his mind as though
    it had been straight in front of his eyes. Suddenly he realized
    what was the matter. The man was dying of starvation.
    The same thought seemed to occur almost simultaneously
    to everyone in the cell. There was a very faint stirring all
    the way round the bench. The eyes of the chinless man kept
    flitting towards the skull-faced man, then turning guiltily
    away, then being dragged back by an irresistible attraction.
    Presently he began to fidget<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">坐立不安；烦躁 to keep moving your body, your hands or your feet because you are nervous, bored, excited, etc.</sub> on his seat. At last he stood up,
    waddled<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（鸭子似地）蹒跚行走，摇摆地行走 to walk with short steps, swinging from side to side, like a duck</sub> clumsily across the cell, dug down into the pocket
    of his overalls, and, with an abashed<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">羞愧；窘迫；尴尬 embarrassed and ashamed because of sth that you have done</sub> air, held out a grimy<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">沾满污垢的；满是灰尘的 covered with dirt</sub>
    piece of bread to the skull-faced man.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    There was a furious<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">激烈的；猛烈的；高速的；盛怒的 with great energy, speed or anger</sub>, deafening<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">震耳欲聋的；极喧闹的 very loud</sub> roar from the telescreen.
    The chinless man jumped in his tracks. The skull-faced man
    had quickly thrust his hands behind his back, as though
    demonstrating to all the world that he refused the gift.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    ‘Bumstead!’ roared the voice. ‘2713 Bumstead J.! Let fall
    that piece of bread!’
</p>

<p>
    The chinless man dropped the piece of bread on the floor.
</p>

<p>
    ‘Remain standing where you are,’ said the voice. ‘Face the door. Make no movement.’
</p>

<p>
    The chinless man obeyed. His large pouchy<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">袋状的,囊状的,似囊的</sub> cheeks were
    quivering uncontrollably. The door clanged open. As the
    young officer entered and stepped aside, there emerged
    from behind him a short stumpy<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">短而粗的 short and thick</sub> guard with enormous
    arms and shoulders. He took his stand opposite the chinless
    man, and then, at a signal from the officer, let free a
    frightful blow, with all the weight of his body behind it, full
    in the chinless man’s mouth. The force of it seemed almost
    to knock him clear of the floor. His body was flung across
    the cell and fetched up against the base of the lavatory seat.
    For a moment he lay as though stunned, with dark blood
    oozing from his mouth and nose. A very faint whimpering
    or squeaking<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（尤指紧张或激动时）尖声说话 to speak in a very high voice, especially when you are nervous or excited</sub>, which seemed unconscious, came out of
    him. Then he rolled over and raised himself unsteadily on
    hands and knees. Amid a stream of blood and saliva<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">唾液 the liquid that is produced in your mouth that helps you to swallow food</sub>, the
    two halves of a dental plate<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">托牙板；假牙床</sub> fell out of his mouth.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    The prisoners sat very still, their hands crossed on their
    knees. The chinless man climbed back into his place. Down
    one side of his face the flesh was darkening. His mouth had
    swollen into a shapeless cherry-coloured mass with a black
    hole in the middle of it.
</p>

<p>
    From time to time a little blood dripped on to the breast
    of his overalls. His grey eyes still flitted from face to face,
    more guiltily than ever, as though he were trying to discover
    how much the others despised him for his humiliation.
</p>

<p>
    The door opened. With a small gesture the officer indicated the skull-faced man.
</p>

<p>
    ‘Room 101,’ he said.
</p>

<p>
    There was a gasp<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（常指由强烈情感引起的）深吸气，喘息，倒抽气 a quick deep breath, usually caused by a strong emotion</sub> and a flurry<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">一阵忙乱（或激动、兴奋等） an occasion when there is a lot of activity, interest, excitement, etc. within a short period of time</sub> at Winston’s side. The man
    had actually flung himself on his knees on the floor, with
    his hand clasped together.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    ‘Comrade! Officer!’ he cried. ‘You don’t have to take me to
    that place! Haven’t I told you everything already? What else
    is it you want to know? There’s nothing I wouldn’t confess,
    nothing! Just tell me what it is and I’ll confess straight off.
    Write it down and I’ll sign it—anything! Not room 101!’
</p>

<p>
    ‘Room 101,’ said the officer.
</p>

<p>
    The man’s face, already very pale, turned a colour Winston
    would not have believed possible. It was definitely,
    unmistakably, a shade of green.
</p>

<p>
    ‘Do anything to me!’ he yelled. ‘You’ve been starving me
    for weeks. Finish it off and let me die. Shoot me. Hang me.
    Sentence me to twenty-five years. Is there somebody else
    you want me to give away? Just say who it is and I’ll tell you
    anything you want. I don’t care who it is or what you do to
    them. I’ve got a wife and three children. The biggest of them
    isn’t six years old. You can take the whole lot of them and
    cut their throats in front of my eyes, and I’ll stand by and
    watch it. But not Room 101!’
</p>

<p>
    ‘Room 101,’ said the officer.
</p>

<p>
    The man looked frantically<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">疯狂似地</sub> round at the other prisoners,
    as though with some idea that he could put another victim
    in his own place. His eyes settled on the smashed face of the
    chinless man. He flung out a lean arm.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    ‘That’s the one you ought to be taking, not me!’ he shouted.
    ‘You didn’t hear what he was saying after they bashed
    his face. Give me a chance and I’ll tell you every word of it.
    HE’S the one that’s against the Party, not me.’ The guards
    stepped forward. The man’s voice rose to a shriek<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">尖叫 a loud high shout, for example one that you make when you are excited, frightened or in pain</sub>. ‘You
    didn’t hear him!’ he repeated. ‘Something went wrong with
    the telescreen. HE’S the one you want. Take him, not me!’
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    The two sturdy guards had stooped to take him by the
    arms. But just at this moment he flung himself across the
    floor of the cell and grabbed one of the iron legs that supported
    the bench. He had set up a wordless howling<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">嚎叫；咆哮</sub>, like an
    animal. The guards took hold of him to wrench<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">猛拉；猛扭；猛拧 to pull or twist sth/sb/yourself suddenly and violently</sub> him loose,
    but he clung on with astonishing strength. For perhaps
    twenty seconds they were hauling at him. The prisoners sat
    quiet, their hands crossed on their knees, looking straight
    in front of them. The howling stopped; the man had no
    breath left for anything except hanging on. Then there was
    a different kind of cry. A kick from a guard’s boot had broken
    the fingers of one of his hands. They dragged him to
    his feet.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    ‘Room 101,’ said the officer.
</p>

<p>
    The man was led out, walking unsteadily, with head
    sunken, nursing his crushed hand, all the fight had gone
    out of him.
</p>

<p>
    A long time passed. If it had been midnight when the
    skull-faced man was taken away, it was morning: if morning,
    it was afternoon. Winston was alone, and had been
    alone for hours. The pain of sitting on the narrow bench
    was such that often he got up and walked about, unreproved
    by the telescreen. The piece of bread still lay where the chinless
    man had dropped it. At the beginning it needed a hard
    effort not to look at it, but presently hunger gave way to
    thirst. His mouth was sticky<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">黏（性）的 made of or covered in a substance that sticks to things that touch it</sub> and evil-tasting. The humming
    sound and the unvarying white light induced a sort
    of faintness<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">眩晕；虚弱；近乎；昏厥 the state of feeling weak and tired and likely to become unconscious</sub>, an empty feeling inside his head. He would get
    up because the ache in his bones was no longer bearable,
    and then would sit down again almost at once because he
    was too dizzy to make sure of staying on his feet. Whenever
    his physical sensations were a little under control the terror
    returned. Sometimes with a fading hope he thought of
    O’Brien and the razor blade. It was thinkable that the razor
    blade might arrive concealed in his food, if he were ever
    fed. More dimly he thought of Julia. Somewhere or other
    she was suffering perhaps far worse than he. She might be
    screaming with pain at this moment. He thought: ‘If I could
    save Julia by doubling my own pain, would I do it? Yes, I
    would.’ But that was merely an intellectual decision, taken
    because he knew that he ought to take it. He did not feel it.
    In this place you could not feel anything, except pain and
    foreknowledge of pain. Besides, was it possible, when you
    were actually suffering it, to wish for any reason that your
    own pain should increase? But that question was not answerable yet.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    The boots were approaching again. The door opened. O’Brien came in.
</p>

<p>
    Winston started to his feet. The shock of the sight had
    driven all caution out of him. For the first time in many
    years he forgot the presence of the telescreen.
</p>

<p>
    ‘They’ve got you too!’ he cried.
</p>

<p>
    ‘They got me a long time ago,’ said O’Brien with a mild,
    almost regretful irony. He stepped aside. From behind him
    there emerged a broad-chested guard with a long black
    truncheon<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">警棍 a short thick stick that police officers carry as a weapon</sub> in his hand.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    ‘You know this, Winston,’ said O’Brien. ‘Don’t deceive
    yourself. You did know it—you have always known it.’
</p>

<p>
    Yes, he saw now, he had always known it. But there was no
    time to think of that. All he had eyes for was the truncheon
    in the guard’s hand. It might fall anywhere; on the crown,
    on the tip of the ear, on the upper arm, on the elbow——
</p>

<p>
    The elbow! He had slumped<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">重重地坐下（或倒下）to sit or fall down heavily</sub> to his knees, almost paralysed,
    clasping the stricken elbow with his other hand.
    Everything had exploded into yellow light. Inconceivable,
    inconceivable that one blow could cause such pain! The
    light cleared and he could see the other two looking down
    at him. The guard was laughing at his contortions. One
    question at any rate was answered. Never, for any reason
    on earth, could you wish for an increase of pain. Of pain
    you could wish only one thing: that it should stop. Nothing
    in the world was so bad as physical pain. In the face of pain
    there are no heroes, no heroes, he thought over and over as
    he writhed<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（常指因剧痛不停地）扭动，翻滚to twist or move your body without stopping, often because you are in great pain</sub> on the floor, clutching<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">紧握；抱紧；抓紧 to hold sb/sth tightly</sub> uselessly at his disabled
    left arm.
