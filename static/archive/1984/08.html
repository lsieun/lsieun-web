    From somewhere at the bottom of a passage the smell of
    roasting coffee—real coffee, not Victory Coffee—came
    floating out into the street. Winston paused involuntarily<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">身不由己地,不由自主地</sub>.
    For perhaps two seconds he was back in the half-forgotten
    world of his childhood. Then a door banged, seeming to cut
    off the smell as abruptly as though it had been a sound.

    He had walked several kilometres over pavements, and
    his varicose ulcer was throbbing<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（有规律地）抽动，抽痛to feel a series of regular painful movements</sub>. This was the second time
    in three weeks that he had missed an evening at the Community
    Centre: a rash act, since you could be certain that
    the number of your attendances at the Centre was carefully
    checked. In principle a Party member had no spare
    time, and was never alone except in bed. It was assumed
    that when he was not working, eating, or sleeping he would
    be taking part in some kind of communal recreation: to do
    anything that suggested a taste for solitude, even to go for a
    walk by yourself, was always slightly dangerous. There was
    a word for it in Newspeak: OWNLIFE, it was called, meaning
    individualism<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">个人主义；个人至上the belief that individual people in society should have the right to make their own decisions, etc., rather than be controlled by the government</sub> and eccentricity<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">古怪行为；反常behaviour that people think is strange or unusual</sub>. But this evening as he
    came out of the Ministry the balminess<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">温和；芳香。balmy表示“温暖惬意的”，warm and pleasant</sub> of the April air had
    tempted him. The sky was a warmer blue than he had seen it
    that year, and suddenly the long, noisy evening at the Centre,
    the boring, exhausting games, the lectures, the creaking
    camaraderie oiled by gin, had seemed intolerable. On impulse
    he had turned away from the bus-stop and wandered
    off into the labyrinth of London, first south, then east, then
    north again, losing himself among unknown streets and
    hardly bothering in which direction he was going.<sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：读到这儿，我觉得，他危险将近了。该参加的活动没有参加。从故事情节上来，他能一直作为一个“观察者”的身份存在吗？还是说，他必须要亲身经历一些苦难，才能有深刻的、更深刻的认识。我觉得，此时的他已经从“精神”上开始逐步转向自由了，开始偏离那个社会下的预定生活轨道了。</sub>

    ‘If there is hope,’ he had written in the diary, ‘it lies in
    the proles.’ The words kept coming back to him, statement
    of a mystical truth and a palpable<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">易于察觉的；可意识到的；明显的 that is easily noticed by the mind or the senses</sub> absurdity. He was somewhere in
    the vague, brown-coloured slums to the north and
    east of what had once been Saint Pancras Station. He was
    walking up a cobbled<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">铺有鹅卵石的having a surface that is made of cobbles</sub> street of little two-storey houses with
    battered<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">破旧不堪的 old, used a lot, and not in very good condition</sub> doorways which gave straight on the pavement
    and which were somehow curiously suggestive of ratholes<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">被老鼠咬成的洞；鼠穴；狭小龌龊的地方</sub>.
    There were puddles of filthy water here and there among the
    cobbles. In and out of the dark doorways, and down narrow
    alley-ways<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（建筑群中间或后面的）小街，小巷，胡同 a narrow passage behind or between buildings</sub> that branched off on either side, people swarmed
    in astonishing numbers—girls in full bloom, with crudely
    lipsticked mouths, and youths who chased the girls, and
    swollen waddling women who showed you what the girls
    would be like in ten years’ time, and old bent creatures shuffling
    along on splayed feet, and ragged barefooted children
    who played in the puddles and then scattered at angry yells
    from their mothers. Perhaps a quarter of the windows in
    the street were broken and boarded up. Most of the people
    paid no attention to Winston; a few eyed him with a sort of
    guarded curiosity. Two monstrous women with brick-red
    forearms folded across their aprons<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">围裙a piece of clothing worn over the front of the body, from the chest or the waist down, and tied around the waist. Aprons are worn over other clothes to keep them clean, for example when cooking.</sub> were talking outside a
    doorway. Winston caught scraps<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">碎片，小块（纸、布匹等）a small piece of sth, especially paper, cloth, etc.</sub> of conversation as he approached.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>

<p class="indented">
    ‘’Yes,’ I says to ‘er, ‘that’s all very well,’ I says. ‘But if you’d
    of been in my place you’d of done the same as what I done.
    It’s easy to criticize,’ I says, ‘but you ain’t got the same problems
    as what I got.‘‘
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Ah,’ said the other, ‘that’s jest<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">开玩笑；说笑话to say things that are not serious or true, especially in order to make sb laugh</sub> it. That’s jest where it is.’
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    The strident<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">刺耳的 having a loud, rough and unpleasant sound</sub> voices stopped abruptly. The women studied<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">审视；端详；细看to watch, or look at sb/sth carefully in order to find out sth</sub> him in hostile silence as he went past. But it was not
    hostility, exactly; merely a kind of wariness<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">谨慎;警惕。wary，（对待人或事物时）小心的，谨慎的，留神的，小心翼翼的 careful when dealing with sb/sth because you think that there may be a danger or problem</sub>, a momentary
    stiffening, as at the passing of some unfamiliar animal. The
    blue overalls of the Party could not be a common sight in
    a street like this. Indeed, it was unwise to be seen in such
    places, unless you had definite business there. The patrols
    might stop you if you happened to run into them. ‘May I see
    your papers, comrade? What are you doing here? What time
    did you leave work? Is this your usual way home?’—and so
    on and so forth. Not that there was any rule against walking
    home by an unusual route: but it was enough to draw attention
    to you if the Thought Police heard about it.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Suddenly the whole street was in commotion. There
    were yells of warning from all sides. People were shooting
    into the doorways like rabbits. A young woman leapt out
    of a doorway a little ahead of Winston, grabbed up a tiny
    child playing in a puddle, whipped her apron round it, and
    leapt back again, all in one movement. At the same instant a
    man in a concertina-like black suit, who had emerged from
    a side alley<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（建筑群中间或后面的）小街，小巷，胡同 a narrow passage behind or between buildings</sub>, ran towards Winston, pointing excitedly to the
    sky.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Steamer!’ he yelled. ‘Look out, guv’nor! Bang over’ead!
    Lay down quick!’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Steamer’ was a nickname which, for some reason, the
    proles applied to rocket bombs. Winston promptly flung
    himself on his face. The proles were nearly always right
    when they gave you a warning of this kind. They seemed
    to possess some kind of instinct which told them several
    seconds in advance when a rocket was coming, although
    the rockets supposedly travelled faster than sound. Winston
    clasped<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">抱紧；紧紧拥抱to hold sb/sth tightly with your arms around them</sub> his forearms above his head. There was a roar
    that seemed to make the pavement heave; a shower of light<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">轻的；轻便的；不太重的easy to lift or move; not weighing very much</sub>
    objects pattered<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">发出轻快的拍打声 to make quick, light sounds as a surface is being hit several times</sub> on to his back. When he stood up he found
    that he was covered with fragments of glass from the nearest window.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    He walked on. The bomb had demolished<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（意外）毁坏，破坏 to destroy sth accidentally</sub> a group of
    houses 200 metres up the street. A black plume<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">飘升之物a cloud of sth that rises and curves upwards in the air</sub> of smoke
    hung in the sky, and below it a cloud of plaster<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">灰泥 a substance made of lime , water and sand, that is put on walls and ceilings to give them a smooth hard surface</sub> dust in which
    a crowd was already forming around the ruins. There was a
    little pile of plaster lying on the pavement ahead of him, and
    in the middle of it he could see a bright red streak<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">条纹；条痕a long thin mark or line that is a different colour from the surface it is on</sub>. When he
    got up to it he saw that it was a human hand severed at the
    wrist. Apart from the bloody stump<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">残肢 the short part of sb's leg or arm that is left after the rest has been cut off</sub>, the hand was so completely
    whitened as to resemble a plaster cast.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    He kicked the thing into the gutter<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">路旁排水沟；阴沟 a channel at the edge of a road where water collects and is carried away to drains</sub>, and then, to avoid
    the crowd, turned down a side-street to the right. Within
    three or four minutes he was out of the area which the
    bomb had affected, and the sordid<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">肮脏的；污秽的very dirty and unpleasant</sub> swarming life of the
    streets was going on as though nothing had happened. It
    was nearly twenty hours, and the drinking-shops which the
    proles frequented (’pubs’, they called them) were choked<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">阻塞，塞满，堵塞（通道、空间等）to block or fill a passage, space, etc. so that movement is difficult</sub>
    with customers. From their grimy swing doors, endlessly
    opening and shutting, there came forth a smell of urine<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">尿；小便 the waste liquid that collects in the bladder and that you pass from your body</sub>,
    sawdust, and sour beer. In an angle formed by a projecting
    house-front three men were standing very close together,
    the middle one of them holding a folded-up newspaper
    which the other two were studying over his shoulder. Even
    before he was near enough to make out the expression on
    their faces, Winston could see absorption in every line of
    their bodies. It was obviously some serious piece of news
    that they were reading. He was a few paces away from them
    when suddenly the group broke up and two of the men were
    in violent altercation. For a moment they seemed almost on
    the point of blows<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（用手、武器等的）猛击a hard hit with the hand, a weapon, etc.</sub>.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Can’t you bleeding well listen to what I say? I tell you
    no number ending in seven ain’t won for over fourteen
    months!’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Yes, it ‘as, then!’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘No, it ‘as not! Back ‘ome I got the ‘ole lot of ‘em for over

</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Yes, a seven ‘AS won! I could pretty near tell you the
    bleeding number. Four oh seven, it ended in. It were in February—second
    week in February.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘February your grandmother! I got it all down in black
    and white. An’ I tell you, no number——’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Oh, pack it in!’ said the third man.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    They were talking about the Lottery. Winston looked
    back when he had gone thirty metres. They were still arguing,
    with vivid, passionate faces. The Lottery, with its
    weekly pay-out of enormous prizes, was the one public event
    to which the proles paid serious attention. It was probable
    that there were some millions of proles for whom the Lottery
    was the principal if not the only reason for remaining
    alive. It was their delight, their folly, their anodyne<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">不得罪人的；温和的 unlikely to cause disagreement or offend anyone; not expressing strong opinions</sub>, their
    intellectual stimulant. Where the Lottery was concerned,
    even people who could barely read and write seemed capable
    of intricate calculations and staggering feats of memory.
    There was a whole tribe<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（尤指同一职业的）一伙（人），一帮（人），一类（人）a group or class of people, especially of one profession</sub> of men who made a living simply by
    selling systems, forecasts, and lucky amulets<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">护身符，驱邪物（为祛邪防病等佩戴的珠宝）a piece of jewellery that some people wear because they think it protects them from bad luck, illness, etc.</sub>. Winston had
    nothing to do with the running of the Lottery, which was
    managed by the Ministry of Plenty, but he was aware (indeed
    everyone in the party was aware) that <strong>the prizes were
    largely imaginary. Only small sums were actually paid out,
    the winners of the big prizes being non-existent persons.</strong> In
    the absence of any real intercommunication between one
    part of Oceania and another, this was not difficult to arrange.

<p class="indented">
    But if there was hope, it lay in the proles. You had to cling
    on to that. When you put it in words it sounded reasonable:
    it was when you looked at the human beings passing you on
    the pavement that it became an act of faith. The street into
    which he had turned ran downhill. He had a feeling that he
    had been in this neighbourhood before, and that there was
    a main thoroughfare<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">大街；大道；通衢 a public road or street used by traffic, especially a main road in a city or town</sub> not far away. From somewhere ahead
    there came a din<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">喧嚣声；嘈杂声；吵闹声 a loud, unpleasant noise that lasts for a long time</sub> of shouting voices. The street took a sharp
    turn and then ended in a flight<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">一段楼梯；一段阶梯a series of steps between two floors or levels</sub> of steps which led down into
    a sunken alley where a few stall-keepers were selling tired-looking
    vegetables. At this moment Winston remembered
    where he was. The alley led out into the main street, and
    down the next turning, not five minutes away, was the junk-shop
    where he had bought the blank book which was now
    his diary. And in a small stationer’s shop not far away he
    had bought his penholder and his bottle of ink.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    He paused for a moment at the top of the steps. On the
    opposite side of the alley there was a dingy<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">又黑又脏的；昏暗的；肮脏的 dark and dirty</sub> little pub<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">酒吧；酒馆 a building where people go to drink and meet their friends. Pubs serve alcoholic and other drinks, and often also food.</sub> whose
    windows appeared to be frosted over but in reality were
    merely coated with dust. A very old man, bent but active,
    with white moustaches that bristled forward like those of a
    prawn<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">大虾；明虾 a shellfish with ten legs and a long tail, that can be eaten. Prawns turn pink when cooked.</sub>, pushed open the swing door and went in.
    As Winston stood watching, it occurred to him that the old man,
    who must be eighty at the least, had already been middle-aged
    when the Revolution happened. He and a few others
    like him were the last links that now existed with the vanished
    world of capitalism. In the Party itself there were not
    many people left whose ideas had been formed before the
    Revolution. The older generation had mostly been wiped out
    in the great purges of the fifties and sixties, and the few who
    survived had long ago been terrified into complete intellectual
    surrender. If there was any one still alive who could
    give you a truthful account of conditions in the early part
    of the century, it could only be a prole. Suddenly the passage
    from the history book that he had copied into his diary
    came back into Winston’s mind, and a lunatic impulse took
    hold of him. He would go into the pub, he would scrape
    acquaintance with that old man and question him. He would
    say to him: ‘Tell me about your life when you were a boy.
    What was it like in those days? Were things better than they
    are now, or were they worse?’
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Hurriedly, lest he should have time to become frightened,
    he descended the steps and crossed the narrow street. It
    was madness of course. As usual, there was no definite rule
    against talking to proles and frequenting their pubs, but it
    was far too unusual an action to pass unnoticed. If the patrols
    appeared he might plead<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">解释；推说；找借口to give sth as an explanation or excuse for sth</sub> an attack of faintness<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">眩晕；虚弱；近乎；昏厥the state of feeling weak and tired and likely to become unconscious</sub>, but it
    was not likely that they would believe him. He pushed open
    the door, and a hideous cheesy<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">干酪气味的；干酪味道的smelling or tasting of cheese</sub> smell of sour beer hit him in
    the face. As he entered the din of voices dropped to about
    half its volume. Behind his back he could feel everyone eyeing
    his blue overalls. A game of darts<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">掷镖游戏（常见于英国酒吧里）a game in which darts are thrown at a round board marked with numbers for scoring. Darts is often played in British pubs.</sub> which was going on at
    the other end of the room interrupted itself for perhaps as
    much as thirty seconds. The old man whom he had followed
    was standing at the bar, having some kind of altercation
    with the barman, a large, stout<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">肥胖的；肥壮的rather fat</sub>, hook-nosed young man
    with enormous forearms. A knot<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">一小群人a small group of people standing close together</sub> of others, standing round
    with glasses in their hands, were watching the scene.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘I arst you civil enough, didn’t I?’ said the old man,
    straightening his shoulders pugnaciously<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">爱争执的；好斗的；爱滋事的having a strong desire to argue or fight with other people</sub>. ‘You telling me
    you ain’t got a pint<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">一品脱啤酒（尤用于酒吧）a pint of beer (especially in a pub)</sub> mug in the ‘ole bleeding boozer?’
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘And what in hell’s name IS a pint?’ said the barman, leaning
    forward with the tips of his fingers on the counter.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘’Ark at ‘im! Calls ‘isself a barman and don’t know what
    a pint is! Why, a pint’s the ‘alf of a quart, and there’s four
    quarts to the gallon. ‘Ave to teach you the A, B, C next.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Never heard of ‘em,’ said the barman shortly. ‘Litre and
    half litre—that’s all we serve. There’s the glasses on the shelf
    in front of you.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘I likes a pint,’ persisted the old man. ‘You could ‘a drawed
    me off a pint easy enough. We didn’t ‘ave these bleeding litres
    when I was a young man.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘When you were a young man we were all living in the
    treetops,’ said the barman, with a glance at the other customers.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    There was a shout of laughter, and the uneasiness caused
    by Winston’s entry seemed to disappear. The old man’s white stubbled<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">满脸短胡子的</sub>
    face had flushed pink. He turned away, muttering
    to himself, and bumped<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（无意地）碰，撞to hit sb/sth by accident</sub> into Winston. Winston caught him
    gently by the arm.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘May I offer you a drink?’ he said.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘You’re a gent,’ said the other, straightening his shoulders
    again. He appeared not to have noticed Winston’s blue
    overalls. ‘Pint!’ he added aggressively to the barman. ‘Pint
    of wallop.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    The barman swished two half-litres of dark-brown beer
    into thick glasses which he had rinsed in a bucket under
    the counter. Beer was the only drink you could get in prole
    pubs. The proles were supposed not to drink gin, though in
    practice they could get hold of it easily enough. The game of
    darts was in full swing again, and the knot of men at the bar
    had begun talking about lottery tickets. Winston’s presence
    was forgotten for a moment. There was a deal table under
    the window where he and the old man could talk without
    fear of being overheard. It was horribly dangerous, but at
    any rate there was no telescreen in the room, a point he had
    made sure of as soon as he came in.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘’E could ‘a drawed me off a pint,’ grumbled the old man
    as he settled down behind a glass. ‘A ‘alf litre ain’t enough. It
    don’t satisfy. And a ‘ole litre’s too much. It starts my bladder<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">膀胱an organ that is shaped like a bag in which liquid waste(= urine ) collects before it is passed out of the body</sub>
    running. Let alone the price.’
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘You must have seen great changes since you were a young
    man,’ said Winston tentatively.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    The old man’s pale blue eyes moved from the darts board
    to the bar, and from the bar to the door of the Gents, as
    though it were in the bar-room that he expected the changes
    to have occurred.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘The beer was better,’ he said finally. ‘And cheaper! When
    I was a young man, mild beer—wallop we used to call it—
    was fourpence a pint. That was before the war, of course.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Which war was that?’ said Winston.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘It’s all wars,’ said the old man vaguely. He took up his
    glass, and his shoulders straightened again. ‘’Ere’s wishing
    you the very best of ‘ealth!’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    In his lean throat the sharp-pointed Adam’s apple<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">喉结；亚当的苹果</sub> made
    a surprisingly rapid up-and-down movement, and the beer
    vanished. Winston went to the bar and came back with two
    more half-litres. The old man appeared to have forgotten
    his prejudice against drinking a full litre.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘You are very much older than I am,’ said Winston. ‘You
    must have been a grown man before I was born. You can
    remember what it was like in the old days, before the Revolution.
    People of my age don’t really know anything about
    those times. We can only read about them in books, and
    what it says in the books may not be true. I should like your
    opinion on that. The history books say that life before the
    Revolution was completely different from what it is now.
    There was the most terrible oppression, injustice, poverty
    worse than anything we can imagine. Here in London, the
    great mass of the people never had enough to eat from birth
    to death. Half of them hadn’t even boots on their feet. They
    worked twelve hours a day, they left school at nine, they
    slept ten in a room. And at the same time there were a very
    few people, only a few thousands—the capitalists, they were
    called—who were rich and powerful. They owned everything
    that there was to own. They lived in great gorgeous
    houses with thirty servants, they rode about in motor-cars
    and four-horse carriages, they drank champagne, they wore
    top hats——’

    The old man brightened suddenly.

    ‘Top ‘ats!’ he said. ‘Funny you should mention ‘em. The
    same thing come into my ‘ead only yesterday, I dono why. I
    was jest thinking, I ain’t seen a top ‘at in years. Gorn right
    out, they ‘ave. The last time I wore one was at my sister-in-
    law’s funeral. And that was—well, I couldn’t give you the
    date, but it must’a been fifty years ago. Of course it was only
    ‘ired for the occasion, you understand.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘It isn’t very important about the top hats,’ said Winston
    patiently. ‘The point is, these capitalists—they and a few
    lawyers and priests and so forth who lived on them—were
    the lords of the earth. Everything existed for their benefit.
    You—the ordinary people, the workers—were their slaves.
    They could do what they liked with you. They could ship
    you off to Canada like cattle. They could sleep with your
    daughters if they chose. They could order you to be flogged
    with something called a cat-o’-nine tails. You had to take
    your cap off when you passed them. Every capitalist went

    The old man brightened again.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Lackeys!’ he said. ‘Now there’s a word I ain’t ‘eard since
    ever so long. Lackeys! That reg’lar takes me back, that does.
    I recollect oh, donkey’s years ago—I used to sometimes go
    to ‘Yde Park of a Sunday afternoon to ‘ear the blokes<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">男人；家伙a man</sub> making

    couldn’t give you ‘is name, but a real powerful speaker ‘e
    was. ‘E didn’t ‘alf give it ‘em! ‘Lackeys!’ ‘e says, ‘lackeys of

    that was another of them. And ‘yenas—’e definitely called
    ‘em ‘yenas. Of course ‘e was referring to the Labour Party,
    you understand.’

<p class="indented">
    Winston had the feeling that they were talking at cross-purposes<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（由于谈论或针对不同事情而未意识到的）相互不理解，相互误解 if two people are at cross purposes, they do not understand each other because they are talking about or aiming at different things, without realizing it</sub>.

</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘What I really wanted to know was this,’ he said. ‘Do you
    feel that you have more freedom now than you had in those
    days? Are you treated more like a human being? In the old
    days, the rich people, the people at the top——’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘The ‘Ouse of Lords,’ put in the old man reminiscently<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">回忆地；回忆往事</sub>.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘The House of Lords, if you like. What I am asking is,
    were these people able to treat you as an inferior, simply
    because they were rich and you were poor? Is it a fact, for
    instance, that you had to call them ‘Sir’ and take off your
    cap when you passed them?’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    The old man appeared to think deeply. He drank off
    about a quarter of his beer before answering.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Yes,’ he said. ‘They liked you to touch your cap to ‘em.
    It showed respect, like. I didn’t agree with it, myself, but I
    done it often enough. Had to, as you might say.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘And was it usual—I’m only quoting what I’ve read in history
    books—was it usual for these people and their servants
    to push you off the pavement into the gutter?’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘One of ‘em pushed me once,’ said the old man. ‘I recollect
    it as if it was yesterday. It was Boat Race night—terribly
    rowdy they used to get on Boat Race night—and I bumps
    into a young bloke on Shaftesbury Avenue. Quite a gent,
    ‘e was—dress shirt, top ‘at, black overcoat. ‘E was kind of

</p>

<p class="indented">
    A sense of helplessness took hold of Winston. The old
    man’s memory was nothing but a rubbish-heap of details.
    One could question him all day without getting any real
    information. The party histories might still be true, after a
    fashion: they might even be completely true. He made a last
    attempt.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Perhaps I have not made myself clear,’ he said. ‘What I’m
    trying to say is this. You have been alive a very long time;
    you lived half your life before the Revolution. In 1925, for
    instance, you were already grown up. Would you say from
    what you can remember, that life in 1925 was better than it
    is now, or worse? If you could choose, would you prefer to
    live then or now?’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    The old man looked meditatively at the darts board. He
    finished up his beer, more slowly than before. When he
    spoke it was with a tolerant philosophical air, as though the
    beer had mellowed him.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘I know what you expect me to say,’ he said. ‘You expect
    me to say as I’d sooner be young again. Most people’d say
    they’d sooner be young, if you arst’ ‘em. You got your ‘ealth
    and strength when you’re young. When you get to my time
    of life you ain’t never well. I suffer something wicked from
    my feet, and my bladder’s jest terrible. Six and seven times
    a night it ‘as me out of bed. On the other ‘and, there’s great
    advantages in being a old man. You ain’t got the same worries.
    No truck with women, and that’s a great thing. I ain’t
    ‘ad a woman for near on thirty year, if you’d credit it. Nor
    wanted to, what’s more.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Winston sat back against the window-sill. It was no use
    going on. He was about to buy some more beer when the old
    man suddenly got up and shuffled rapidly into the stinking
    urinal at the side of the room. The extra half-litre was
    already working on him. Winston sat for a minute or two
    gazing at his empty glass, and hardly noticed when his feet
    carried him out into the street again. Within twenty years
    at the most, he reflected, the huge and simple question,
    ‘Was life better before the Revolution than it is now?’ would
    have ceased once and for all to be answerable. But in effect
    it was unanswerable even now, since the few scattered survivors
    from the ancient world were incapable of comparing
    one age with another. They remembered a million useless
    things, a quarrel with a workmate, a hunt for a lost bicycle
    pump, the expression on a long-dead sister’s face, the
    swirls of dust on a windy morning seventy years ago: but
    all the relevant facts were outside the range of their vision.
    They were like the ant, which can see small objects but not
    large ones. <strong>And when memory failed and written records
    were falsified—when that happened, the claim of the Party
    to have improved the conditions of human life had got to be
    accepted, because there did not exist, and never again could
    exist, any standard against which it could be tested.</strong>

</p>

<p class="indented">
    At this moment his train<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">一系列相关的事情（或行动）a series of events or actions that are connected</sub> of thought stopped abruptly.
    He halted and looked up. He was in a narrow street, with a
    few dark little shops, interspersed among dwelling-houses.
    Immediately above his head there hung three discoloured
    metal balls which looked as if they had once been gilded.
    He seemed to know the place. Of course! He was standing
    outside the junk-shop where he had bought the diary.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    A twinge<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（一阵）不快，难过，痛苦a sudden short feeling of an unpleasant emotion</sub> of fear went through him. It had been a sufficiently rash act to buy the book in the beginning, and he
    had sworn never to come near the place again. And yet the
    instant that he allowed his thoughts to wander, his feet had
    brought him back here of their own accord. It was precisely
    against suicidal impulses of this kind that he had hoped to
    guard himself by opening the diary. At the same time he
    noticed that although it was nearly twenty-one hours the
    shop was still open. With the feeling that he would be less
    conspicuous inside than hanging about on the pavement,
    he stepped through the doorway. If questioned, he could
    plausibly say that he was trying to buy razor blades.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    The proprietor had just lighted a hanging oil lamp which
    gave off an unclean but friendly smell. He was a man of perhaps
    sixty, frail and bowed, with a long, benevolent nose,
    and mild eyes distorted by thick spectacles. His hair was almost
    white, but his eyebrows were bushy and still black. His
    spectacles, his gentle, fussy movements, and the fact that he
    was wearing an aged jacket of black velvet, gave him a vague
    air of intellectuality, as though he had been some kind of
    literary man, or perhaps a musician. His voice was soft, as
    though faded, and his accent less debased than that of the
    majority of proles.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘I recognized you on the pavement,’ he said immediately.
    ‘You’re the gentleman that bought the young lady’s keepsake
    album. That was a beautiful bit of paper, that was. Cream-
    laid, it used to be called. There’s been no paper like that
    made for—oh, I dare say fifty years.’ He peered at Winston
    over the top of his spectacles. ‘Is there anything special I
    can do for you? Or did you just want to look round?’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘I was passing,’ said Winston vaguely. ‘I just looked in. I
    don’t want anything in particular.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘It’s just as well,’ said the other, ‘because I don’t suppose
    I could have satisfied you.’ He made an apologetic gesture
    with his softpalmed hand. ‘You see how it is; an empty shop,
    you might say. Between you and me, the antique trade’s just
    about finished. No demand any longer, and no stock either.
    Furniture, china, glass it’s all been broken up by degrees.
    And of course the metal stuff’s mostly been melted down. I
    haven’t seen a brass candlestick in years.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    The tiny interior of the shop was in fact uncomfortably
    full, but there was almost nothing in it of the slightest value.
    The floorspace was very restricted, because all round
    the walls were stacked innumerable dusty picture-frames.
    In the window there were trays of nuts and bolts, worn-out
    chisels, penknives with broken blades, tarnished watches
    that did not even pretend to be in going order, and other
    miscellaneous rubbish. Only on a small table in the corner
    was there a litter of odds and ends—lacquered snuffbox-
    es, agate brooches, and the like—which looked as though
    they might include something interesting. As Winston
    wandered towards the table his eye was caught by a round,
    smooth thing that gleamed softly in the lamplight, and he
    picked it up.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    It was a heavy lump of glass, curved on one side, flat
    on the other, making almost a hemisphere. There was a
    peculiar softness, as of rainwater, in both the colour and
    the texture of the glass. At the heart of it, magnified by the
    curved surface, there was a strange, pink, convoluted object
    that recalled a rose or a sea anemone.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘What is it?’ said Winston, fascinated.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘That’s coral<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">珊瑚 a hard substance that is red, pink or white in colour, and that forms on the bottom of the sea from the bones of very small creatures. Coral is often used in jewellery.</sub>, that is,’ said the old man. ‘It must have come
    from the Indian Ocean. They used to kind of embed it in
    the glass. That wasn’t made less than a hundred years ago.
    More, by the look of it.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘It’s a beautiful thing,’ said Winston.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘It is a beautiful thing,’ said the other appreciatively. ‘But
    there’s not many that’d say so nowadays.’ He coughed. ‘Now,
    if it so happened that you wanted to buy it, that’d cost you
    four dollars. I can remember when a thing like that would
    have fetched eight pounds, and eight pounds was—well, I
    can’t work it out, but it was a lot of money. But who cares
    about genuine antiques nowadays—even the few that’s
    left?’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Winston immediately paid over the four dollars and slid
    the coveted<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">令人垂涎的；令人羡慕的</sub> thing into his pocket. What appealed to him
    about it was not so much its beauty as the air it seemed to
    possess of belonging to an age quite different from the present one.
    The soft, rainwatery glass was not like any glass that
    he had ever seen. The thing was doubly attractive because
    of its apparent uselessness, though he could guess that it
    must once have been intended as a paperweight<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">镇纸 a small heavy object that you put on top of loose papers to keep them in place</sub>. It was very
    heavy in his pocket, but fortunately it did not make much
    of a bulge. It was a queer thing, even a compromising thing,
    for a Party member to have in his possession. Anything old,
    and for that matter anything beautiful, was always vaguely
    suspect. The old man had grown noticeably more cheerful
    after receiving the four dollars. Winston realized that he
    would have accepted three or even two.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘There’s another room upstairs that you might care to
    take a look at,’ he said. ‘There’s not much in it. Just a few
    pieces. We’ll do with a light if we’re going upstairs.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    He lit another lamp, and, with bowed back, led the way
    slowly up the steep and worn stairs and along a tiny passage,
    into a room which did not give on the street but looked out
    on a cobbled yard and a forest of chimney-pots. Winston
    noticed that the furniture was still arranged as though the
    room were meant to be lived in. There was a strip of carpet
    on the floor, a picture or two on the walls, and a deep,
    slatternly arm-chair drawn up to the fireplace. An old-fashioned
    glass clock with a twelve-hour face was ticking away
    on the mantelpiece. Under the window, and occupying
    nearly a quarter of the room, was an enormous bed with
    the mattress still on it.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘We lived here till my wife died,’ said the old man half
    apologetically. ‘I’m selling the furniture off by little and
    little. Now that’s a beautiful mahogany<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">红木；桃花心木the hard reddish-brown wood of a tropical tree, used for making furniture</sub> bed, or at least it
    would be if you could get the bugs out of it. But I dare say
    you’d find it a little bit cumbersome.’
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    He was holdlng the lamp high up, so as to illuminate the
    whole room, and in the warm dim light the place looked
    curiously inviting. The thought flitted through Winston’s
    mind that it would probably be quite easy to rent the room
    for a few dollars a week, if he dared to take the risk. It was a
    wild, impossible notion, to be abandoned as soon as thought
    of; but the room had awakened in him a sort of nostalgia, a
    sort of ancestral memory. It seemed to him that he knew
    exactly what it felt like to sit in a room like this, in an arm-chair
    beside an open fire with your feet in the fender and a
    kettle on the hob; utterly alone, utterly secure, with nobody
    watching you, no voice pursuing you, no sound except the
    singing of the kettle and the friendly ticking of the clock.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘There’s no telescreen!’ he could not help murmuring.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Ah,’ said the old man, ‘I never had one of those things.
    Too expensive. And I never seemed to feel the need of it,
    somehow. Now that’s a nice gateleg table in the corner there.
    Though of course you’d have to put new hinges on it if you
    wanted to use the flaps.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    There was a small bookcase in the other corner, and
    Winston had already gravitated towards it. It contained
    nothing but rubbish. The hunting-down and destruction of
    books had been done with the same thoroughness in the
    prole quarters as everywhere else. It was very unlikely that
    there existed anywhere in Oceania a copy of a book printed
    earlier than 1960. The old man, still carrying the lamp, was
    standing in front of a picture in a rosewood frame which
    hung on the other side of the fireplace, opposite the bed.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Now, if you happen to be interested in old prints at all—
    —’ he began delicately.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Winston came across to examine the picture. It was a
    steel engraving of an oval building with rectangular windows,
    and a small tower in front. There was a railing
    running round the building, and at the rear end there was
    what appeared to be a statue. Winston gazed at it for some
    moments. It seemed vaguely familiar, though he did not remember the statue.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘The frame’s fixed to the wall,’ said the old man, ‘but I
    could unscrew it for you, I dare say.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘I know that building,’ said Winston finally. ‘It’s a ruin
    now. It’s in the middle of the street outside the Palace of
    Justice.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘That’s right. Outside the Law Courts. It was bombed in—
    oh, many years ago. It was a church at one time, St Clement
    Danes, its name was.’ He smiled apologetically, as though
    conscious of saying something slightly ridiculous, and added:
    ‘Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement’s!’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘What’s that?’ said Winston.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Oh—‘Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement’s.’
    That was a rhyme we had when I was a little boy. How it goes
    on I don’t remember, but I do know it ended up, ‘Here comes
    a candle to light you to bed, Here comes a chopper to chop
    off your head.’ It was a kind of a dance. They held out their
    arms for you to pass under, and when they came to ‘Here
    comes a chopper to chop off your head’ they brought their
    arms down and caught you. It was just names of churches.
    All the London churches were in it—all the principal ones,
    that is.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Winston wondered vaguely to what century the church
    belonged. It was always difficult to determine the age of a
    London building. Anything large and impressive, if it was
    reasonably new in appearance, was automatically claimed
    as having been built since the Revolution, while anything
    that was obviously of earlier date was ascribed to some dim
    period called the Middle Ages. The centuries of capitalism
    were held to have produced nothing of any value. One could
    not learn history from architecture any more than one
    could learn it from books. Statues, inscriptions, memorial
    stones, the names of streets—anything that might throw
    light upon the past had been systematically altered.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘I never knew it had been a church,’ he said.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘There’s a lot of them left, really,’ said the old man, ‘though
    they’ve been put to other uses. Now, how did that rhyme go?
    Ah! I’ve got it!
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement’s, You
    owe me three farthings, say the bells of St Martin’s——‘
</p>

<p class="indented">
    there, now, that’s as far as I can get. A farthing, that was
    a small copper coin, looked something like a cent.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Where was St Martin’s?’ said Winston.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘St Martin’s? That’s still standing. It’s in Victory Square,
    alongside the picture gallery. A building with a kind of a triangular
    porch and pillars in front, and a big flight of steps.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Winston knew the place well. It was a museum used
    for propaganda displays of various kinds—scale models of
    rocket bombs and Floating Fortresses, waxwork tableaux illustrating
    enemy atrocities, and the like.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘St Martin’s-in-the-Fields it used to be called,’ supplemented
    the old man, ‘though I don’t recollect any fields
    anywhere in those parts.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Winston did not buy the picture. It would have been an
    even more incongruous<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">不合适的；不相称的；不协调的strange, and not suitable in a particular situation</sub> possession than the glass paperweight, and impossible to carry home, unless it were taken
    out of its frame. But he lingered for some minutes more,
    talking to the old man, whose name, he discovered, was not
    Weeks—as one might have gathered from the inscription<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（书首页的）题词；（石头或金属上）刻写的文字，铭刻，碑文 words written in the front of a book or cut in stone or metal</sub>
    over the shop-front<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">铺面
    the outside part of a shop that is on the street, where the main entrance is</sub> — but Charrington. Mr Charrington, it
    seemed, was a widower aged sixty-three and had inhabited
    this shop for thirty years. Throughout that time he had
    been intending to alter the name over the window, but had
    never quite got to the point of doing it. All the while that
    they were talking the half-remembered rhyme<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">押韵词；同韵词 a word that has the same sound or ends with the same sound as another word</sub> kept running
    through Winston’s head. Oranges and lemons say the
    bells of St Clement’s, You owe me three farthings<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">法寻（英国旧硬币，值 旧便士）in the past, a British coin worth one quarter of an old penny</sub>, say the
    bells of St Martin’s! It was curious, but when you said it to
    yourself you had the illusion of actually hearing bells, the
    bells of a lost London that still existed somewhere or other,
    disguised and forgotten. From one ghostly steeple<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（教堂的）尖塔 a tall pointed tower on the roof of a church, often with a spire on it</sub> after another
    he seemed to hear them pealing<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">大声作响
    to ring a bell loudly and sonorously, or be rung in this way</sub> forth. Yet so far as
    he could remember he had never in real life heard church
    bells ringing.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    He got away from Mr Charrington and went down the
    stairs alone, so as not to let the old man see him reconnoitring<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">侦察；勘察；观测 to get information about an area, especially for military purposes, by using soldiers, planes, etc.</sub>
    the street before stepping out of the door. He had
    already made up his mind that after a suitable interval—a

    again. It was perhaps not more dangerous than shirking<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">逃避（工作）；躲懒 to avoid doing sth you should do, especially because you are too lazy</sub> an
    evening at the Centre. The serious piece of folly<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">愚蠢；愚笨；愚蠢的想法（或事情、行为） a lack of good judgement; the fact of doing sth stupid; an activity or idea that shows a lack of judgement</sub> had been to
    come back here in the first place, after buying the diary and
    without knowing whether the proprietor<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">业主；所有人 the owner of a business, a hotel, etc.</sub> of the shop could
    be trusted. However——!

    Yes, he thought again, he would come back. He would
    buy further scraps<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">碎片，小块（纸、布匹等）a small piece of sth, especially paper, cloth, etc.</sub> of beautiful rubbish. He would buy the
    engraving of St Clement Danes, take it out of its frame, and
    carry it home concealed under the jacket of his overalls. He
    would drag the rest of that poem out of Mr Charrington’s
    memory. Even the lunatic project of renting the room upstairs
    flashed momentarily through his mind again. For
    perhaps five seconds exaltation<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">兴奋；兴高采烈 a feeling of very great joy or happiness</sub> made him careless, and he
    stepped out on to the pavement without so much as a preliminary
    glance through the window. He had even started
    humming to an improvised tune

    Suddenly his heart seemed to turn to ice and his bowels<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">肠 the tube along which food passes after it has been through the stomach, especially the end where waste is collected before it is passed out of the body</sub>
    to water. A figure in blue overalls was coming down
    the pavement, not ten metres away. It was the girl from the
    Fiction Department, the girl with dark hair. The light was
    failing<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">衰退中的

    looked him straight in the face, then walked quickly on as
    though she had not seen him.

    For a few seconds Winston was too paralysed to move.
    Then he turned to the right and walked heavily away, not
    noticing for the moment that he was going in the wrong
    direction. At any rate, one question was settled. There was
    no doubting any longer that the girl was spying on him. She
    must have followed him here, because it was not credible
    that by pure chance she should have happened to be walking
    on the same evening up the same obscure backstreet,
    kilometres distant from any quarter where Party members
    lived. It was too great a coincidence. Whether she was really
    an agent of the Thought Police, or simply an amateur spy
    actuated<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">激励；驱使 to make sb behave in a particular way</sub> by officiousness<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">多管闲事</sub>, hardly mattered. It was enough
    that she was watching him. Probably she had seen him go
    into the pub as well.

    It was an effort to walk. The lump<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（通常为无定形的）块a piece of sth hard or solid, usually without a particular shape</sub> of glass in his pocket
    banged against his thigh at each step, and he was half minded
    to take it out and throw it away. The worst thing was the
    pain in his belly. For a couple of minutes he had the feeling
    that he would die if he did not reach a lavatory soon. But
    there would be no public lavatories in a quarter like this.
    Then the spasm<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">痉挛；抽搐 a sudden and often painful contracting of a muscle, which you cannot control</sub> passed, leaving a dull ache behind.

    The street was a blind alley. Winston halted, stood
    for several seconds wondering vaguely what to do, then
    turned round and began to retrace his steps. As he turned
    it occurred to him that the girl had only passed him three
    minutes ago and that by running he could probably catch
    up with her. He could keep on her track till they were in
    some quiet place, and then smash her skull in with a cobblestone.
    The piece of glass in his pocket would be heavy
    enough for the job. But he abandoned the idea immediately,
    because even the thought of making any physical effort was
    unbearable. He could not run, he could not strike a blow.
    Besides, she was young and lusty<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">健壮的；强壮的healthy and strong</sub> and would defend herself.
    He thought also of hurrying to the Community Centre and
    staying there till the place closed, so as to establish a partial
    alibi<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">借口；托辞an excuse for sth that you have done wrong</sub> for the evening. But that too was impossible. A deadly
    lassitude<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">倦怠；疲乏；无精打采a state of feeling very tired in mind or body; lack of energy</sub> had taken hold of him. All he wanted was to get
    home quickly and then sit down and be quiet.

    It was after twenty-two hours when he got back to the
    flat. The lights would be switched off at the main at twenty-three thirty.
    He went into the kitchen and swallowed nearly
    a teacupful of Victory Gin. Then he went to the table in the
    alcove<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">壁凹，凹室，壁龛（房内墙壁凹进空间）an area in a room that is formed by part of a wall being built farther back than the rest of the wall</sub>, sat down, and took the diary out of the drawer. But
    he did not open it at once. From the telescreen a brassy<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">声高刺耳的；喧闹的；嘈杂的 loud and unpleasant</sub> female
    voice was squalling<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">大声啼哭；号哭to cry very loudly and noisily</sub> a patriotic<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">爱国的having or expressing a great love of your country</sub> song. He sat staring at
    the marbled<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">有大理石颜色（或花纹）的having the colours and/or patterns of marble</sub> cover of the book, trying without success to
    shut the voice out of his consciousness.

    It was at night that they came for you, always at night. The
    proper thing was to kill yourself before they got you. Undoubtedly
    some people did so. Many of the disappearances
    were actually suicides. But it needed desperate courage to
    kill yourself in a world where firearms<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（便携式的）枪a gun that can be carried</sub>, or any quick and
    certain poison, were completely unprocurable<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">不可获得性。procure，（设法）获得，取得，得到to obtain sth, especially with difficulty</sub>. He thought
    with a kind of astonishment of the biological uselessness
    of pain and fear, the treachery<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">背叛；变节；背信弃义 behaviour that involves not being loyal to sb who trusts you</sub> of the human body which
    always freezes into inertia<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">缺乏活力；惰性；保守lack of energy; lack of desire or ability to move or change</sub> at exactly the moment when a

    girl if only he had acted quickly enough: but precisely
    because of the extremity of his danger he had lost the power
    to act. It struck him that in moments of crisis one is never
    fighting against an external enemy, but always against
    one’s own body. Even now, in spite of the gin, the dull ache
    in his belly made consecutive thought impossible. And it
    is the same, he perceived, in all seemingly heroic or tragic
    situations. On the battlefield, in the torture chamber, on
    a sinking ship, the issues that you are fighting for are always
    forgotten, because the body swells up until it fills the
    universe, and even when you are not paralysed by fright or
    screaming with pain, <strong>life is a moment-to-moment struggle
    against hunger or cold or sleeplessness, against a sour
    stomach or an aching tooth</strong>.

    He opened the diary. It was important to write something
    down. The woman on the telescreen had started a new
    song. Her voice seemed to stick into his brain like jagged<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">凹凸不平的；有尖突的；锯齿状的with rough, pointed, often sharp edges</sub>
    splinters<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（木头、金属、玻璃等的）尖碎片，尖细条a small thin sharp piece of wood, metal, glass, etc. that has broken off a larger piece</sub> of glass. He tried to think of O’Brien, for whom,
    or to whom, the diary was written, but instead he began
    thinking of the things that would happen to him after the
    Thought Police took him away. It would not matter if they
    killed you at once. To be killed was what you expected. But
    before death (nobody spoke of such things, yet everybody
    knew of them) there was the routine of confession that had
    to be gone through: the grovelling<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">卑躬屈膝 to behave in a very humble way towards sb who is more important than you or who can give you sth you want</sub> on the floor and screaming
    for mercy, the crack of broken bones, the smashed teeth,

    Why did you have to endure it, since the end was always
    the same? Why was it not possible to cut a few days
    or weeks out of your life? Nobody ever escaped detection,
    and nobody ever failed to confess. When once you had succumbed
    to thoughtcrime it was certain that by a given date
    you would be dead. Why then did that horror, which altered
    nothing, have to lie embedded in future time?

<p class="indented">
    He tried with a little more success than before to summon
    up the image of O’Brien. ‘<i>We shall meet in the place
    where there is no darkness</i>,’ O’Brien had said to him. He
    knew what it meant, or thought he knew. The place where
    there is no darkness was the imagined future, which one
    would never see, but which, by foreknowledge, one could
    mystically share in. But with the voice from the telescreen
    nagging<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">唠叨；不停地抱怨 to keep complaining to sb about their behaviour or keep asking them to do sth</sub> at his ears he could not follow the train of thought
    further. He put a cigarette in his mouth. Half the tobacco
    promptly fell out on to his tongue, a bitter dust which was
    difficult to spit out again. The face of Big Brother swam into
    his mind, displacing that of O’Brien. Just as he had done a
    few days earlier, he slid a coin out of his pocket and looked
    at it. The face gazed up at him, heavy, calm, protecting: but
    what kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark moustache?
    Like a leaden<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">铅灰色的dull grey in colour, like lead</sub> knell<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">钟声</sub> the words came back at him:
