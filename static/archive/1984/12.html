    Winston looked round the shabby little room above Mr Charrington’s
    shop. Beside the window the enormous
    bed was made up, with ragged blankets and a coverless bolster<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">垫枕（长而厚）a long thick pillow that is placed across the top of a bed under the other pillows</sub>.
    The old-fashioned clock with the twelve-hour face was
    ticking away on the mantelpiece<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">壁炉台 a shelf above a fireplace</sub>. In the corner, on the gate-leg table<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">折叠式桌子</sub>,
    the glass paperweight which he had bought on his
    last visit gleamed softly out of the half-darkness.

    burner<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（取暖用的）炉子 a large, solid, metal piece of equipment for burning wood or coal, used for heating a room</sub> and set a pan of water to boil. He had brought an
    envelope full of Victory Coffee and some saccharine tablets.
    The clock’s hands said seventeen-twenty: it was nineteen-twenty
    really. She was coming at nineteen-thirty.

    commit, this one was the least possible to conceal. Actually
    the idea had first floated into his head in the form of a
    vision, of the glass paperweight mirrored by the surface of
    the gate-leg table. As he had foreseen, Mr Charrington had
    made no difficulty about letting the room. He was obviously
    glad of the few dollars that it would bring him. Nor did he
    seem shocked or become offensively knowing when it was
    made clear that Winston wanted the room for the purpose
    of a love-affair. Instead he looked into the middle distance
    and spoke in generalities, with so delicate an air as to give
    the impression that he had become partly invisible. Privacy,
    he said, was a very valuable thing. Everyone wanted a place
    where they could be alone occasionally. And when they had
    such a place, it was only common courtesy in anyone else
    who knew of it to keep his knowledge to himself. He even,
    seeming almost to fade out of existence as he did so, added
    that there were two entries to the house, one of them
    through the back yard, which gave on an alley<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（建筑群中间或后面的）小街，小巷，胡同a narrow passage behind or between buildings</sub>.

    Under the window somebody was singing. Winston
    peeped out, secure in the protection of the muslin curtain.
    The June sun was still high in the sky, and in the sun-filled
    court below, a monstrous woman, solid as a Norman pillar,
    with brawny red forearms and a sacking<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">粗麻布</sub> apron strapped<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">用带子系（或捆、扎、扣）好 to fasten sb/sth in place using a strap or straps</sub>

    and a clothes line, pegging out a series of square white

    The tune had been haunting London for weeks past. It
    was one of countless similar songs published for the benefit
    of the proles by a sub-section of the Music Department.
    The words of these songs were composed without any human
    intervention whatever on an instrument known as a
    versificator. But the woman sang so tunefully as to turn the
    dreadful rubbish into an almost pleasant sound. He could
    hear the woman singing and the scrape of her shoes on the
    flagstones<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">石板（方形，用于铺地面、小径等）a large flat square piece of stone that is used for floors, paths, etc.</sub>, and the cries of the children in the street, and
    somewhere in the far distance a faint roar of traffic, and yet
    the room seemed curiously silent, thanks to the absence of
    a telescreen.

<p class="indented">
    Folly, folly, folly! he thought again. It was inconceivable
    that they could frequent this place for more than a few
    weeks without being caught. But the temptation of having a
    hiding-place that was truly their own, indoors and near at
    hand, had been too much for both of them. For some time
    after their visit to the church belfry<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（尤指教堂的）钟楼，钟塔a tower in which bells hang, especially as part of a church</sub> it had been impossible
    to arrange meetings. Working hours had been drastically
    increased in anticipation of Hate Week. It was more than
    a month distant, but the enormous, complex preparations
    that it entailed were throwing extra work on to everybody.
    Finally both of them managed to secure a free afternoon on
    the same day. They had agreed to go back to the clearing
    in the wood. On the evening beforehand they met briefly
    in the street. As usual, Winston hardly looked at Julia as
    they drifted towards one another in the crowd, but from
    the short glance he gave her it seemed to him that she was
    paler than usual.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘It’s all off,’ she murmured as soon as she judged it safe to
    speak. ‘Tomorrow, I mean.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘What?’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Tomorrow afternoon. I can’t come.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Why not?’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Oh, the usual reason. It’s started early this time.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    For a moment he was violently angry. During the month
    that he had known her the nature of his desire for her had
    changed. At the beginning there had been little true sensuality in it.
    Their first love-making had been simply an act
    of the will. But after the second time it was different. The
    smell of her hair, the taste of her mouth, the feeling of her
    skin seemed to have got inside him, or into the air all round
    him. She had become a physical necessity, something that
    he not only wanted but felt that he had a right to. When she
    said that she could not come, he had the feeling that she was
    cheating him. But just at this moment the crowd pressed
    them together and their hands accidentally met. She gave
    the tips of his fingers a quick squeeze that seemed to invite
    not desire but affection. It struck him that when one
    lived with a woman this particular disappointment must be
    a normal, recurring event; and a deep tenderness, such as
    he had not felt for her before, suddenly took hold of him. He
    wished that they were a married couple of ten years’ standing.
    He wished that he were walking through the streets
    with her just as they were doing now but openly and without
    fear, talking of trivialities and buying odds and ends
    for the household. He wished above all that they had some
    place where they could be alone together without feeling
    the obligation to make love every time they met. It was not
    actually at that moment, but at some time on the following
    day, that the idea of renting Mr Charrington’s room had occurred
    to him. When he suggested it to Julia she had agreed
    with unexpected readiness. Both of them knew that it was
    lunacy<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">愚蠢的行为；疯狂 behaviour that is stupid or crazy</sub>. It was as though they were intentionally stepping
    nearer to their graves. As he sat waiting on the edge of the
    bed he thought again of the cellars of the Ministry of Love.
    It was curious how that predestined horror moved in and
    out of one’s consciousness. There it lay, fixed in future times,
    preceding death as surely as 99 precedes 100. One could not
    avoid it, but one could perhaps postpone it: and yet instead,
    every now and again, by a conscious, wilful act, one chose
    to shorten the interval before it happened.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    At this moment there was a quick step on the stairs. Julia
    burst<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">猛冲；突然出现to go or move somewhere suddenly with great force; to come from somewhere suddenly</sub> into the room. She was carrying a tool-bag of coarse
    brown canvas, such as he had sometimes seen her carrying
    to and fro at the Ministry. He started forward to take her in
    his arms, but she disengaged herself rather hurriedly, partly
    because she was still holding the tool-bag.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Half a second,’ she said. ‘Just let me show you what I’ve
    brought. Did you bring some of that filthy Victory Coffee?
    I thought you would. You can chuck<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（随便或贸然地）扔，抛 to throw sth carelessly or without much thought</sub> it away again, because
    we shan’t be needing it. Look here.’
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    She fell on her knees, threw open the bag, and tumbled
    out some spanners<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">扳手；扳子；扳钳a metal tool with a specially shaped end for holding and turning nuts and bolts (= small metal rings and pins that hold things together)</sub> and a screwdriver<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">螺丝刀；改锥a tool with a narrow blade that is specially shaped at the end, used for turning screws</sub> that filled the top part
    of it. Underneath were a number of neat paper packets. The
    first packet that she passed to Winston had a strange and
    yet vaguely familiar feeling. It was filled with some kind of
    heavy, sand-like stuff which yielded wherever you touched
    it.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘It isn’t sugar?’ he said.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Real sugar. Not saccharine, sugar. And here’s a loaf of
    bread—proper white bread, not our bloody stuff—and a little
    pot of jam. And here’s a tin of milk—but look! This is the
    one I’m really proud of. I had to wrap a bit of sacking round
    it, because——’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    But she did not need to tell him why she had wrapped it
    up. The smell was already filling the room, a rich hot smell
    which seemed like an emanation from his early childhood,
    but which one did occasionally meet with even now, blowing
    down a passage-way before a door slammed, or diffusing
    itself mysteriously in a crowded street, sniffed for an instant
    and then lost again.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘It’s coffee,’ he murmured, ‘real coffee.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘It’s Inner Party coffee. There’s a whole kilo here,’ she said.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘How did you manage to get hold of all these things?’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘It’s all Inner Party stuff. There’s nothing those swine
    don’t have, nothing. But of course waiters and servants and
    people pinch<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">偷摸；行窃to steal sth, especially sth small and not very valuable</sub> things, and—look, I got a little packet of tea
    as well.’
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Winston had squatted down beside her. He tore open a
    corner of the packet.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘It’s real tea. Not blackberry leaves.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘There’s been a lot of tea about lately. They’ve captured India,
    or something,’ she said vaguely. ‘But listen, dear. I want
    you to turn your back on me for three minutes. Go and sit
    on the other side of the bed. Don’t go too near the window.
    And don’t turn round till I tell you.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Winston gazed abstractedly through the muslin curtain.
    Down in the yard the red-armed woman was still marching
    to and fro between the washtub and the line. She took two
    more pegs out of her mouth and sang with deep feeling:
</p>

<pre>
    <i>
    They sye that time ‘eals all things,
    They sye you can always forget;
    But the smiles an’ the tears acrorss the years
    They twist my
    ‘eart-strings yet!
    </i>
</pre>

<p class="indented">
    She knew the whole drivelling song by heart, it seemed.
    Her voice floated upward with the sweet summer air, very
    tuneful, charged with a sort of happy melancholy. One had
    the feeling that she would have been perfectly content, if the
    June evening had been endless and the supply of clothes inexhaustible,
    to remain there for a thousand years, pegging
    out diapers and singing rubbish. It struck him as a curious
    fact that he had never heard a member of the Party singing
    alone and spontaneously. It would even have seemed slightly
    unorthodox, a dangerous eccentricity, like talking to oneself.
    Perhaps it was only when people were somewhere near
    the starvation level that they had anything to sing about.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘You can turn round now,’ said Julia.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    He turned round, and for a second almost failed to recognize her.
    What he had actually expected was to see her
    naked. But she was not naked. The transformation that had
    happened was much more surprising than that. She had
    painted her face.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    She must have slipped into some shop in the proletarian
    quarters and bought herself a complete set of make-up materials.
    Her lips were deeply reddened, her cheeks rouged,
    her nose powdered; there was even a touch of something
    under the eyes to make them brighter. It was not very skilfully
    done, but Winston’s standards in such matters were
    not high. He had never before seen or imagined a woman of
    the Party with cosmetics<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">化妆品；美容品 a substance that you put on your face or body to make it more attractive</sub> on her face. The improvement in
    her appearance was startling. With just a few dabs of colour
    in the right places she had become not only very much prettier,
    but, above all, far more feminine. Her short hair and
    boyish overalls merely added to the effect. As he took her in
    his arms a wave of synthetic violets flooded his nostrils<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">鼻孔 either of the two openings at the end of the nose that you breathe through</sub>. He
    remembered the half-darkness of a basement kitchen, and a
    woman’s cavernous<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">大而空的；又黑又深的；像洞穴的very large and often empty and/or dark; like a cave</sub> mouth. It was the very same scent that
    she had used; but at the moment it did not seem to matter.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Scent too!’ he said.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Yes, dear, scent too. And do you know what I’m going to
    do next? I’m going to get hold of a real woman’s frock<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">连衣裙；女装a dress</sub> from
    somewhere and wear it instead of these bloody trousers. I’ll
    wear silk stockings and high-heeled shoes! In this room I’m
    going to be a woman, not a Party comrade.’
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    They flung their clothes off and climbed into the huge
    mahogany<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">红木；桃花心木the hard reddish-brown wood of a tropical tree, used for making furniture</sub> bed. It was the first time that he had stripped
    himself naked in her presence. Until now he had been too
    much ashamed of his pale and meagre<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">少量且劣质的small in quantity and poor in quality</sub> body, with the varicose
    veins standing out on his calves and the discoloured
    patch over his ankle. There were no sheets, but the blanket
    they lay on was threadbare<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">穿旧的；磨薄的；破旧的old and thin because it has been used a lot</sub> and smooth, and the size and
    springiness of the bed astonished both of them. ‘It’s sure
    to be full of bugs, but who cares?’ said Julia. One never saw
    a double bed nowadays, except in the homes of the proles.
    Winston had occasionally slept in one in his boyhood: Julia
    had never been in one before, so far as she could remember.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Presently they fell asleep for a little while. When Winston
    woke up the hands of the clock had crept round to
    nearly nine. He did not stir, because Julia was sleeping with
    her head in the crook<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">臂弯；肘弯 the place where your arm bends at the elbow</sub> of his arm. Most of her make-up had
    transferred itself to his own face or the bolster<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">垫枕</sub>, but a light
    stain of rouge still brought out the beauty of her cheekbone.
    A yellow ray from the sinking sun fell across the foot of the
    bed and lighted up the fireplace, where the water in the pan
    was boiling fast. Down in the yard the woman had stopped
    singing, but the faint shouts of children floated in from the
    street. He wondered vaguely whether in the abolished past
    it had been a normal experience to lie in bed like this, in
    the cool of a summer evening, a man and a woman with no
    clothes on, making love when they chose, talking of what
    they chose, not feeling any compulsion to get up, simply lying
    there and listening to peaceful sounds outside. Surely
    there could never have been a time when that seemed ordinary?
    Julia woke up, rubbed her eyes, and raised herself on
    her elbow to look at the oil-stove.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Half that water’s boiled away,’ she said. ‘I’ll get up and
    make some coffee in another moment. We’ve got an hour.
    What time do they cut the lights off at your flats?’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Twenty-three thirty.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘It’s twenty-three at the hostel<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">宿舍，招待所（提供廉价食宿服务）a building that provides cheap accommodation and meals to students, workers or travellers</sub>. But you have to get in earlier
    than that, because—Hi! Get out, you filthy brute!’
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    She suddenly twisted herself over in the bed, seized a
    shoe from the floor, and sent it hurtling into the corner with
    a boyish jerk of her arm, exactly as he had seen her fling the
    dictionary at Goldstein, that morning during the Two Minutes Hate.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘What was it?’ he said in surprise.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘A rat. I saw him stick his beastly nose out of the wainscoting.
    There’s a hole down there. I gave him a good fright,
    anyway.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Rats!’ murmured Winston. ‘In this room!’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘They’re all over the place,’ said Julia indifferently as she
    lay down again. ‘We’ve even got them in the kitchen at the
    hostel. Some parts of London are swarming with them. Did
    you know they attack children? Yes, they do. In some of
    these streets a woman daren’t leave a baby alone for two
    minutes. It’s the great huge brown ones that do it. And the
    nasty thing is that the brutes always——’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘DON’T GO ON!’ said Winston, with his eyes tightly shut.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Dearest! You’ve gone quite pale. What’s the matter? Do
    they make you feel sick?’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Of all horrors in the world—a rat!’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    She pressed herself against him and wound her limbs
    round him, as though to reassure him with the warmth
    of her body. He did not reopen his eyes immediately. For
    several moments he had had the feeling of being back in a
    nightmare which had recurred from time to time throughout
    his life. It was always very much the same. He was
    standing in front of a wall of darkness, and on the other
    side of it there was something unendurable, something too
    dreadful to be faced. In the dream his deepest feeling was
    always one of self-deception, because he did in fact know
    what was behind the wall of darkness. With a deadly effort,
    like wrenching a piece out of his own brain, he could even
    have dragged the thing into the open. He always woke up
    without discovering what it was: but somehow it was connected
    with what Julia had been saying when he cut her
    short.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘I’m sorry,’ he said, ‘it’s nothing. I don’t like rats, that’s all.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Don’t worry, dear, we’re not going to have the filthy
    brutes in here. I’ll stuff the hole with a bit of sacking before
    we go. And next time we come here I’ll bring some plaster
    and bung it up properly.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Already the black instant of panic was half-forgotten.
    Feeling slightly ashamed of himself, he sat up against the
    bedhead. Julia got out of bed, pulled on her overalls, and
    made the coffee. The smell that rose from the saucepan<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（带盖，有一长柄或两耳的）深煮锅a deep round metal pot with a lid and one long handle or two short handles, used for cooking things over heat</sub> was
    so powerful and exciting that they shut the window lest
    anybody outside should notice it and become inquisitive.
    What was even better than the taste of the coffee was the
    silky texture given to it by the sugar, a thing Winston had
    almost forgotten after years of saccharine. With one hand
    in her pocket and a piece of bread and jam in the other, Julia
    wandered about the room, glancing indifferently at the
    bookcase, pointing out the best way of repairing the gate-leg
    table, plumping herself down in the ragged arm-chair to
    see if it was comfortable, and examining the absurd twelve-hour
    clock with a sort of tolerant amusement. She brought
    the glass paperweight over to the bed to have a look at it in a
    better light. He took it out of her hand, fascinated, as always,
    by the soft, rain watery appearance of the glass.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘What is it, do you think?’ said Julia.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘I don’t think it’s anything—I mean, I don’t think it was
    ever put to any use. That’s what I like about it. It’s a little
    chunk of history that they’ve forgotten to alter. It’s a message
    from a hundred years ago, if one knew how to read it.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘And that picture over there’—she nodded at the engraving
    on the opposite wall—’would that be a hundred years
    old?’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘More. Two hundred, I dare say. One can’t tell. It’s impossible
    to discover the age of anything nowadays.’
</p>

    She went over to look at it. ‘Here’s where that brute stuck
    his nose out,’ she said, kicking the wainscoting immediately
    below the picture. ‘What is this place? I’ve seen it before
    somewhere.’

    ‘It’s a church, or at least it used to be. St Clement Danes
    its name was.’ The fragment of rhyme that Mr Charrington
    had taught him came back into his head, and he added
    half-nostalgically: ‘Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St
    Clement’s!’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    To his astonishment she capped the line:
</p>

<p class="indented">
    <i>
    ’You owe me three farthings, say the bells of St Martin’s,
    When will you pay me? say the bells of Old Bailey——’
    </i>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘I can’t remember how it goes on after that. But anyway
    I remember it ends up, ‘Here comes a candle to light you to
    bed, here comes a chopper to chop off your head!‘‘
</p>

<p class="indented">
    It was like the two halves of a countersign. But there
    must be another line after ‘the bells of Old Bailey’. Perhaps
    it could be dug out of Mr Charrington’s memory, if he were
    suitably prompted.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Who taught you that?’ he said.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘My grandfather. He used to say it to me when I was a little
    girl. He was vaporized when I was eight—at any rate, he
    disappeared. I wonder what a lemon was,’ she added inconsequently.
    ‘I’ve seen oranges. They’re a kind of round yellow
    fruit with a thick skin.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘I can remember lemons,’ said Winston. ‘They were quite
    common in the fifties. They were so sour that it set your
    teeth on edge even to smell them.’
</p>

    ‘I bet that picture’s got bugs behind it,’ said Julia. ‘I’ll
    take it down and give it a good clean some day. I suppose
    it’s almost time we were leaving. I must start washing this
    paint off. What a bore! I’ll get the lipstick off your face afterwards.’

    Winston did not get up for a few minutes more. The
    room was darkening. He turned over towards the light and
    lay gazing into the glass paperweight. The inexhaustibly
    interesting thing was not the fragment of coral but the interior
    of the glass itself. There was such a depth of it, and
    yet it was almost as transparent as air. It was as though the
    surface of the glass had been the arch of the sky, enclosing
    a tiny world with its atmosphere complete. He had the feeling
    that he could get inside it, and that in fact he was inside
    it, along with the mahogany bed and the gate-leg table, and
    the clock and the steel engraving and the paperweight itself.
    The paperweight was the room he was in, and the coral was
    Julia’s life and his own, fixed in a sort of eternity at the heart
    of the crystal.
