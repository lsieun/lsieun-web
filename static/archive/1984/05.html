    In the low-ceilinged canteen, deep underground, the
    lunch queue jerked slowly forward. The room was already very full and deafeningly<sub class="my_note"
                                                                                          style="color:green">震耳欲聋地</sub>
    noisy. From the grille at the
    counter the steam of stew<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">炖的菜，煨的菜（有肉和蔬菜）a dish of meat and vegetables cooked
    slowly in liquid in a container that has a lid</sub> came pouring forth, with a sour
    metallic<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">金属般的；有金属味（或声音）的that looks, tastes or sounds like metal</sub> smell
    which did not quite overcome the fumes of
    Victory Gin. On the far side of the room there was a small
    bar, a mere hole in the wall, where gin could be bought at
    ten cents the large nip.

    ‘Just the man I was looking for,’ said a voice at Winston’s back.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    He turned round. It was his friend Syme, who worked in
    the Research Department. Perhaps ‘friend’ was not exactly the right word. You did not have friends nowadays, you
    had comrades: but there were some comrades whose society
    was pleasanter than that of others. Syme was a philologist<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">语文学家；语文研究者a
    person who studies philology</sub>, a
    specialist in Newspeak. Indeed, he was one of the enormous
    team of experts now engaged in compiling the Eleventh
    Edition of the Newspeak Dictionary. He was a tiny creature,
    smaller than Winston, with dark hair and large,
    protuberant<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">隆起的；鼓出的；凸起的curving or swelling out from a surface</sub> eyes, at
    once mournful and derisive, which seemed to
    search your face closely while he was speaking to you.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘I wanted to ask you whether you’d got any razor blades,’
    he said.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Not one!’ said Winston with a sort of guilty haste. ‘I’ve
    tried all over the place. They don’t exist any longer.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Everyone kept asking you for razor blades. Actually he
    had two unused ones which he was hoarding<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">秘藏</sub> up. There
    had been a famine of them for months past. At any given
    moment there was some necessary article<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">物件，物品（尤指整套中的一件）a particular item or
    separate thing, especially one of a set</sub> which the Party shops were unable to supply. Sometimes it was buttons,
    sometimes it was darning wool, sometimes it was shoelaces;
    at present it was razor blades. You could only get hold of
    them, if at all, by scrounging more or less furtively on the
    ‘free’ market.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘I’ve been using the same blade for six weeks,’ he added
    untruthfully.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    The queue gave another jerk forward. As they halted he
    turned and faced Syme again. Each of them took a greasy<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">油污的；沾油脂的covered in a
    lot of grease or oil</sub>
    metal tray from a pile at the end of the counter.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Did you go and see the prisoners hanged yesterday?’ said
    Syme.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘I was working,’ said Winston indifferently. ‘I shall see it
    on the flicks<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">电影</sub>, I suppose.’
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘A very inadequate substitute,’ said Syme.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    His mocking eyes roved<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（眼睛）转来转去，环视，打量</sub> over Winston’s face. ‘I know
    you,’ the eyes seemed to say, ‘I see through you. I know very
    well why you didn’t go to see those prisoners hanged.’ In
    an intellectual way, Syme was venomously<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">狠毒地</sub> orthodox. He
    would talk with a disagreeable gloating satisfaction of helicopter raids on enemy villages, and trials and
    confessions
    of thought-criminals, the executions in the cellars of the
    Ministry of Love. Talking to him was largely a matter of
    getting him away from such subjects and entangling him,
    if possible, in the technicalities of Newspeak, on which he
    was authoritative and interesting. Winston turned his head
    a little aside to avoid the scrutiny of the large dark eyes.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘It was a good hanging,’ said Syme reminiscently<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">回忆地；回忆往事</sub>. ‘I think
    it spoils it when they tie their feet together. I like to see them
    kicking. And above all, at the end, the tongue sticking right
    out, and blue—a quite bright blue. That’s the detail that appeals to me.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Nex’, please!’ yelled the white-aproned prole<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">无产者；穷人（含冒犯意，指无产阶级工人）an

<p class="indented">
    Winston and Syme pushed their trays beneath the grille.
    On to each was dumped swiftly the regulation lunch—a
    metal pannikin of pinkish-grey stew, a hunk<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（尤指食物切下或掰下的）大块，大片a large piece

</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘There’s a table over there, under that telescreen,’ said
    Syme. ‘Let’s pick up a gin<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">杜松子酒an alcoholic drink made from grain and
    flavoured with juniper berries . Gin is usually drunk mixed with tonic water or fruit juice.</sub> on the way.’
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    The gin was served out to them in handleless china mugs.
    They threaded<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">穿过；通过；穿行to move or make sth move through a narrow space,
    avoiding things that are in the way</sub> their way across the crowded room and unpacked their trays on to the
    metal-topped table, on one
    corner of which someone had left a pool of stew, a filthy
    liquid mess that had the appearance of vomit. Winston
    took up his mug of gin, paused for an instant to collect his
    nerve, and gulped<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">大口吞咽 to swallow large amounts of food or drink
    quickly</sub> the oily-tasting stuff down. When he
    had winked the tears out of his eyes he suddenly discovered that he was hungry. He began swallowing spoonfuls<sub
        class="my_note" style="color:green">一勺（的量）the amount that a spoon can hold</sub> of
    the stew, which, in among its general sloppiness<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">凌乱；马虎 that shows a lack of

    of spongy<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">海绵似的；柔软吸水的soft and able to absorb water easily like a sponge</sub>
    pinkish<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">浅粉色的；略带桃红色的fairly pink in colour</sub> stuff which was probably a
    preparation
    of meat. Neither of them spoke again till they had emptied
    their pannikins<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">小盘子,小锅</sub>. From the table at Winston’s left, a little
    behind his back, someone was talking rapidly and continuously, a harsh gabble<sub class="my_note"
                                                                                      style="color:green">（尤指许多人同时说话时）急促不清的话

    almost like the quacking of a duck,
    which pierced the general uproar<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">吵闹；喧嚣；叫喊a situation in which people shout
    and make a lot of noise because they are angry or upset about sth</sub> of the room.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘How is the Dictionary getting on?’ said Winston, raising
    his voice to overcome the noise.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Slowly,’ said Syme. ‘I’m on the adjectives. It’s fascinating.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    He had brightened up immediately at the mention of
    Newspeak. He pushed his pannikin aside, took up his hunk
    of bread in one delicate hand and his cheese in the other,
    and leaned across the table so as to be able to speak without
    shouting.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘The Eleventh Edition is the definitive<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">最后的；决定性的；不可更改的final; not able to be
    changed</sub> edition,’ he said.
    ‘We’re getting the language into its final shape—the shape
    it’s going to have when nobody speaks anything else. When
    we’ve finished with it, people like you will have to learn it
    all over again. You think, I dare say, that our chief job is
    inventing new words. But not a bit of it! We’re destroying
    words—scores of them, hundreds of them, every day. We’re
    cutting the language down to the bone. The Eleventh Edition won’t contain a single word that will become obsolete
    before the year 2050.’
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    He bit hungrily into his bread and swallowed a couple
    of mouthfuls, then continued speaking, with a sort of pedant’s passion. His thin dark face had become animated<sub
        class="my_note" style="color:green">兴致勃勃的；活跃的 full of interest and energy</sub>, his
    eyes had lost their mocking expression and grown almost
    dreamy<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">怡然的；恬静的；轻松的pleasant and gentle; that makes you feel relaxed</sub>.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘It’s a beautiful thing, the destruction of words. Of course
    the great wastage is in the verbs and adjectives, but there
    are hundreds of nouns that can be got rid of as well. It isn’t
    only the synonyms; there are also the antonyms. After all,
    what justification<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">正当理由a good reason why sth exists or is done</sub> is
    there for a word which is simply the
    opposite of some other word? A word contains its opposite
    in itself. Take ‘good’, for instance. If you have a word like
    ‘good’, what need is there for a word like ‘bad’? ‘Ungood’
    will do just as well—better, because it’s an exact opposite,
    which the other is not. Or again, if you want a stronger version of ‘good’, what sense is there in having a whole
    string
    of vague useless words like ‘excellent’ and ‘splendid’ and all
    the rest of them? ‘Plusgood’ covers the meaning, or ‘doubleplusgood’ if you want something stronger still. Of course
    we use those forms already. but in the final version of Newspeak there’ll be nothing else. In the end the whole
    notion
    of goodness and badness will be covered by only six words—
    in reality, only one word. Don’t you see the beauty of that,
    Winston? It was B.B.’s idea originally, of course,’ he added
    as an afterthought.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    A sort of vapid<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">乏味的；枯燥的 lacking interest or intelligence</sub> eagerness
    flitted<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">轻快地从一处到另一处；掠过to move lightly and quickly from one place or thing to
    another</sub> across Winston’s face at
    the mention of Big Brother. Nevertheless Syme immediately
    detected a certain lack of enthusiasm.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘You haven’t a real appreciation of Newspeak, Winston,’
    he said almost sadly. ‘Even when you write it you’re still
    thinking in Oldspeak. I’ve read some of those pieces that
    you write in ‘The Times’ occasionally. They’re good enough,
    but they’re translations. In your heart you’d prefer to stick
    to Oldspeak, with all its vagueness and its useless shades<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">略微（差异）a little;
    slightly</sub> of
    meaning. You don’t grasp the beauty of the destruction of
    words. Do you know that Newspeak is the only language in
    the world whose vocabulary gets smaller every year?’
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Winston did know that, of course. He smiled, sympathetically he hoped, not trusting himself to speak. Syme bit
    off another fragment of the dark-coloured bread, chewed it
    briefly, and went on:
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Don’t you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to
    narrow the range of thought?<sub class="my_note" style="color:red">笔记：一个人掌握的词汇量，代表了他的认知空间</sub> In the end we shall
    make
    thoughtcrime literally impossible, because there will be no
    words in which to express it. Every concept that can ever
    be needed, will be expressed by exactly one word, with its
    meaning rigidly defined and all its subsidiary<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">辅助的；附带的；次要的connected with sth
    but less important than it</sub> meanings
    rubbed out and forgotten. Already, in the Eleventh Edition,
    we’re not far from that point. But the process will still be
    continuing long after you and I are dead. Every year fewer
    and fewer words, and the range of consciousness always a
    little smaller. Even now, of course, there’s no reason or excuse for committing thoughtcrime. It’s merely a question
    of self-discipline, reality-control. But in the end there won’t
    be any need even for that. The Revolution will be complete when the language is perfect. Newspeak is Ingsoc and
    Ingsoc is Newspeak,’ he added with a sort of mystical satisfaction. ‘Has it ever occurred to you, Winston, that by
    the
    year 2050, at the very latest, not a single human being will
    be alive who could understand such a conversation as we
    are having now?’
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Except——’ began Winston doubtfully, and he stopped.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    It had been on the tip of his tongue to say ‘Except the
    proles,’ but he checked himself, not feeling fully certain that
    this remark was not in some way unorthodox. Syme, however, had divined<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">猜到；领悟to
    find out sth by guessing</sub> what he was about to say.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘The proles are not human beings,’ he said carelessly. ‘By
    2050—earlier, probably—all real knowledge of Oldspeak
    will have disappeared. The whole literature of the past will
    have been destroyed. Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton, Byron—they’ll exist only in Newspeak versions, not merely
    changed into something different, but actually changed
    into something contradictory of what they used to be. Even
    the literature of the Party will change. Even the slogans will
    change. How could you have a slogan like ‘freedom is slavery’ when the concept of freedom has been abolished? The
    whole climate of thought will be different. In fact there will
    be no thought, as we understand it now. Orthodoxy<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">正统观念；普遍接受的观点an idea or
    view that is generally accepted</sub> means
    not thinking—not needing to think<sub class="my_note" style="color:red">笔记：这里写的“绝”，它所提倡的“正统观念”就是“不思考”、“不需要思考”</sub>.
    Orthodoxy is unconsciousness.’
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    One of these days, thought Winston with sudden deep
    conviction<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">坚定的看法（或信念）a strong opinion or belief</sub>, Syme will be
    vaporized. He is too intelligent. He
    sees too clearly and speaks too plainly. The Party does not
    like such people. One day he will disappear. It is written in
    his face.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Winston had finished his bread and cheese. He turned
    a little sideways in his chair to drink his mug of coffee. At
    the table on his left the man with the strident<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">刺耳的having a loud, rough and
    unpleasant sound</sub> voice was
    still talking remorselessly<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">坚持不懈的</sub> away. A young woman who was
    perhaps his secretary, and who was sitting with her back
    to Winston, was listening to him and seemed to be eagerly
    agreeing with everything that he said. From time to time
    Winston caught some such remark as ‘I think you’re so right,
    I do so agree with you’, uttered in a youthful and rather silly
    feminine voice. But the other voice never stopped for an instant, even when the girl was speaking. Winston knew the
    man by sight, though he knew no more about him than that
    he held some important post in the Fiction Department. He
    was a man of about thirty, with a muscular throat and a
    large, mobile mouth. His head was thrown back a little, and
    because of the angle at which he was sitting, his spectacles
    caught the light and presented to Winston two blank discs
    instead of eyes. What was slightly horrible, was that from
    the stream of sound that poured out of his mouth it was
    almost impossible to distinguish a single word. Just once
    Winston caught a phrase—’complete and final elimination
    of Goldsteinism’—jerked out very rapidly and, as it seemed,
    all in one piece, like a line of type cast solid. For the rest it
    was just a noise, a quack-quack-quacking. And yet, though
    you could not actually hear what the man was saying, you
    could not be in any doubt about its general nature. He might
    be denouncing Goldstein and demanding sterner measures
    against thought-criminals and saboteurs, he might be fulminating<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">愤怒谴责；怒斥to
    criticize sb/sth angrily</sub> against the atrocities<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（尤指战争中的）残暴行为a cruel
    and violent act, especially in a war</sub> of the Eurasian army, he
    might be praising Big Brother or the heroes on the Malabar
    front—it made no difference. Whatever it was, you could
    be certain that every word of it was pure orthodoxy, pure
    Ingsoc. As he watched the eyeless face with the jaw moving
    rapidly up and down, Winston had a curious feeling that
    this was not a real human being but some kind of dummy. It
    was not the man’s brain that was speaking, it was his larynx<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">喉 the area at
    the top of the throat that contains the vocal cords</sub>.
    The stuff that was coming out of him consisted of words, but
    it was not speech in the true sense: it was a noise uttered in
    unconsciousness, like the quacking of a duck.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Syme had fallen silent for a moment, and with the handle of his spoon was tracing patterns in the puddle<sub
        class="my_note" style="color:green">水洼；小水坑；（尤指）雨水坑a small amount of water or other liquid, especially rain, that
    has collected in one place on the ground</sub> of stew.
    The voice from the other table quacked rapidly on, easily
    audible in spite of the surrounding din<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">喧嚣声；嘈杂声；吵闹声a loud, unpleasant noise
    that lasts for a long time</sub>.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘There is a word in Newspeak,’ said Syme, ‘I don’t know
    whether you know it: DUCKSPEAK, to quack like a duck. It
    is one of those interesting words that have two contradictory meanings. Applied to an opponent, it is abuse, applied
    to someone you agree with, it is praise.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Unquestionably Syme will be vaporized, Winston
    thought again. He thought it with a kind of sadness, although well knowing that Syme despised him and slightly
    disliked him, and was fully capable of denouncing him as
    a thought-criminal if he saw any reason for doing so. There
    was something subtly wrong with Syme. There was something that he lacked: discretion, aloofness, a sort of saving
    stupidity. You could not say that he was unorthodox. He believed in the principles of Ingsoc, he venerated Big
    Brother,
    he rejoiced over victories, he hated heretics, not merely with
    sincerity but with a sort of restless zeal, an up-to-dateness
    of information, which the ordinary Party member did not
    approach. Yet a faint air of disreputability always clung to
    him. He said things that would have been better unsaid, he
    had read too many books, he frequented the Chestnut<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">栗子；板栗a smooth brown nut
    of a chestnut tree, some types of which can be eaten</sub> Tree
    Cafe, haunt of painters and musicians. There was no law,
    not even an unwritten law, against frequenting the Chestnut Tree Cafe, yet the place was somehow ill-omened<sub
        class="my_note" style="color:green">凶多吉少的；不吉利的seeming likely to be unlucky or unsuccessful because there are a
    lot of unlucky signs relating to it</sub>. The
    old, discredited leaders of the Party had been used to gather
    there before they were finally purged. Goldstein himself, it
    was said, had sometimes been seen there, years and decades
    ago. Syme’s fate was not difficult to foresee. And yet it was
    a fact that if Syme grasped, even for three seconds, the nature of his, Winston’s, secret opinions, he would betray
    him
    instantly to the Thought Police. So would anybody else, for
    that matter: but Syme more than most. Zeal was not enough.
    Orthodoxy was unconsciousness.

<p class="indented">
    Syme looked up. ‘Here comes Parsons,’ he said.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Something in the tone of his voice seemed to add, ‘that
    bloody fool’. Parsons, Winston’s fellow-tenant at Victory
    Mansions, was in fact threading his way across the room—
    a tubby<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">矮胖的short and slightly fat</sub>, middle-sized man with fair hair and
    a froglike face.
    At thirty-five he was already putting on rolls of fat at neck
    and waistline, but his movements were brisk<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">快的；敏捷的；忙碌的quick; busy</sub> and
    boyish.
    His whole appearance was that of a little boy grown large, so
    much so that although he was wearing the regulation overalls, it was almost impossible not to think of him as being
    dressed in the blue shorts, grey shirt, and red neckerchief
    of the Spies. In visualizing him one saw always a picture
    of dimpled knees and sleeves rolled back from pudgy<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">微胖的slightly fat</sub>
    forearms. Parsons did, indeed, invariably revert to shorts when
    a community hike or any other physical activity gave him

    As though in confirmation of this, a trumpet call floated from the telescreen just above their heads. However, it
    was not the proclamation<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">宣言；公告；声明an official statement about sth important
    that is made to the public; the act of making an official statement</sub> of a military victory this time, but
    merely an announcement from the Ministry of Plenty.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Comrades!’ cried an eager youthful voice. ‘Attention,
    comrades! We have glorious news for you. We have won the
    battle for production! Returns now completed of the output
    of all classes of consumption goods show that the standard
    of living has risen by no less than 20 percent over the past
    year. All over Oceania this morning there were irrepressible

    banners voicing their gratitude to Big Brother for the new,
    happy life which his wise leadership has bestowed upon us.
    Here are some of the completed figures. Foodstuffs——’<img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    The phrase ‘our new, happy life’ recurred several times. It
    had been a favourite of late with the Ministry of Plenty.
    Parsons, his attention caught by the trumpet call, sat listening
    with a sort of gaping solemnity, a sort of edified boredom.
    He could not follow the figures, but he was aware that they
    were in some way a cause for satisfaction. He had lugged<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">使劲拉to carry or drag
    sth heavy with a lot of effort</sub> out
    a huge and filthy pipe which was already half full of charred<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">烧焦的；烧黑的burnt
    and black</sub>
    tobacco. With the tobacco ration at 100 grammes a week it
    was seldom possible to fill a pipe to the top. Winston was
    smoking a Victory Cigarette which he held carefully horizontal.
    The new ration did not start till tomorrow and he
    had only four cigarettes left. For the moment he had shut his
    ears to the remoter noises and was listening to the stuff that
    streamed out of the telescreen. It appeared that there had
    even been demonstrations to thank Big Brother for raising
    the chocolate ration to twenty grammes a week. And only
    yesterday, he reflected, it had been announced that the ration
    was to be REDUCED to twenty grammes a week. Was it
    possible that they could swallow that, after only twenty-four
    hours? Yes, they swallowed it. Parsons swallowed it easily,
    with the stupidity of an animal. The eyeless creature at the
    other table swallowed it fanatically, passionately, with a
    furious desire to track down, denounce, and vaporize anyone
    who should suggest that last week the ration had been thirty
    grammes. Syme, too—in some more complex way, involving doublethink,
    Syme swallowed it. Was he, then, ALONE
    in the possession of a memory?
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    The fabulous statistics continued to pour out of the telescreen.
    As compared with last year there was more food,
    more clothes, more houses, more furniture, more cooking-pots,
    more fuel, more ships, more helicopters, more
    books, more babies—more of everything except disease,
    crime, and insanity<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">精神失常；精神错乱；精神病the state of being insane</sub>. Year by
    year and minute by minute,
    everybody and everything was whizzing<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">嗖嗖地移动；飞速行驶to move very quickly, making
    a high continuous sound</sub> rapidly upwards.
    As Syme had done earlier Winston had taken up his spoon
    and was dabbling<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">玩水；嬉水to move your hands, feet, etc. around in water</sub>
    in the pale-coloured gravy<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（调味）肉汁a brown sauce made by adding flour to the

    across the table, drawing a long streak<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">条纹；条痕a long thin mark or line that
    is a different colour from the surface it is on</sub> of it out into a pattern.
    He meditated resentfully on the physical texture of
    life. Had it always been like this? Had food always tasted
    like this? He looked round the canteen. A low-ceilinged,
    crowded room, its walls grimy<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">沾满污垢的；满是灰尘的covered with dirt</sub> from the
    contact of innumerable bodies; battered<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">破旧不堪的old, used a lot, and not in
    very good condition</sub> metal tables and chairs, placed
    so close together that you sat with elbows touching; bent
    spoons, dented trays, coarse white mugs; all surfaces greasy<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">多油的；油污的；沾油脂的covered

    crack; and a sourish<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">微酸的</sub>, composite smell of bad
    gin and bad coffee and metallic stew and dirty clothes.
    Always in your stomach and in your skin there was a sort of
    protest, a feeling that you had been cheated of something
    that you had a right to. It was true that he had no memories
    of anything greatly different. In any time that he could accurately
    remember, there had never been quite enough to
    eat, one had never had socks or underclothes that were not
    full of holes, furniture had always been battered and rickety<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">不结实的；不稳固的；易折断的not
    strong or well made; likely to break</sub>,
    rooms underheated, tube trains crowded, houses falling to
    pieces, bread dark-coloured, tea a rarity, coffee filthy-tasting,
    cigarettes insufficient—nothing cheap and plentiful
    except synthetic gin. And though, of course, it grew worse
    as one’s body aged, was it not a sign that this was NOT the
    natural order of things, if one’s heart sickened at the discomfort
    and dirt and scarcity<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">缺乏；不足；稀少</sub>, the interminable<sub class="my_note"
                                                                                                       style="color:green">冗长的；没完没了的lasting

    cigarettes that came to pieces,
    the food with its strange evil tastes? Why should one feel

    He looked round the canteen again. Nearly everyone was
    ugly, and would still have been ugly even if dressed otherwise
    than in the uniform blue overalls. On the far side of the
    room, sitting at a table alone, a small, curiously beetle-like
    man was drinking a cup of coffee, his little eyes darting suspicious
    glances from side to side. How easy it was, thought
    Winston, if you did not look about you, to believe that the
    physical type set up by the Party as an ideal—tall muscular
    youths and deep-bosomed maidens, blond-haired, vital<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">热情洋溢的full of energy and
    enthusiasm</sub>,
    sunburnt, carefree<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">无忧无虑的；无牵挂的；无责任的having no worries or
    responsibilities</sub>—existed and even predominated.
    Actually, so far as he could judge, the majority of people in
    Airstrip One were small, dark, and ill-favoured<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">
    (容貌)丑的,不漂亮的;使人不快的</sub>. It was curious
    how that beetle-like type proliferated in the Ministries:
    little dumpy men, growing stout<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">肥胖的；肥壮的rather fat</sub> very early in life,
    with
    short legs, swift scuttling movements, and fat inscrutable<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">难以捉摸的；难以理解的
    not expressing anything clearly and thus hard to interpret</sub>
    faces with very small eyes. It was the type that seemed to
    flourish best under the dominion of the Party.

<p class="indented">
    The announcement from the Ministry of Plenty ended
    on another trumpet call and gave way to tinny music.
    Parsons, stirred to vague enthusiasm by the bombardment<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">炮击;轰炸,轰击
    an attack on a place made by dropping bombs from airplanes or by firing large guns for a long time</sub> of
    figures, took his pipe out of his mouth.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘The Ministry of Plenty’s certainly done a good job this
    year,’ he said with a knowing shake of his head. ‘By the way,
    Smith old boy, I suppose you haven’t got any razor blades
    you can let me have?’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Not one,’ said Winston. ‘I’ve been using the same blade
    for six weeks myself.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Ah, well—just thought I’d ask you, old boy.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Sorry,’ said Winston.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    The quacking voice from the next table, temporarily silenced
    during the Ministry’s announcement, had started up
    again, as loud as ever. For some reason Winston suddenly
    found himself thinking of Mrs Parsons, with her wispy<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">一绺绺的；一缕缕的；成束的；纤细的consisting
    of small, thin pieces; not thick</sub> hair
    and the dust in the creases<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（皮肤上，尤指脸上的）皱纹a line in the skin, especially on
    the face</sub> of her face. Within two years
    those children would be denouncing her to the Thought
    Police. Mrs Parsons would be vaporized. Syme would be
    vaporized. Winston would be vaporized. O’Brien would
    be vaporized. Parsons, on the other hand, would never be
    vaporized. The eyeless creature with the quacking voice
    would never be vaporized. The little beetle-like men who
    scuttle so nimbly<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">敏捷地,灵活地</sub> through the labyrinthine corridors of
    Ministries they, too, would never be vaporized. And the girl
    with dark hair, the girl from the Fiction Department—she
    would never be vaporized either. It seemed to him that he
    knew instinctively who would survive and who would perish:
    though just what it was that made for survival, it was
    not easy to say.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    At this moment he was dragged out of his reverie<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">幻想；白日梦；梦想a state of
    thinking about pleasant things, almost as though you are dreaming</sub> with
    a violent jerk<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">急拉；猛推；猝然一动to move or to make sth move with a sudden short
    sharp movement</sub>. The girl at the next table had turned partly
    round and was looking at him. It was the girl with dark hair.
    She was looking at him in a sidelong<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">侧眼偷看的；斜着眼看的；睨视的out of the corner of
    your eye, especially in a way that is secret or disapproving</sub> way, but with curious
    intensity. The instant she caught his eye she looked away
    again.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    The sweat started out on Winston’s backbone. A horrible
    pang of terror went through him. It was gone almost at
    once, but it left a sort of nagging<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">纠缠不休的；难以摆脱的continuing for a long time
    and difficult to cure or remove</sub> uneasiness behind. Why
    was she watching him? Why did she keep following him
    about? Unfortunately he could not remember whether she
    had already been at the table when he arrived, or had come
    there afterwards. But yesterday, at any rate, during the Two
    Minutes Hate, she had sat immediately behind him when
    there was no apparent need to do so. Quite likely her real
    object<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">目的；目标an aim or a purpose</sub> had been to listen to him and make
    sure whether he
    was shouting loudly enough.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    His earlier thought returned to him: probably she was
    not actually a member of the Thought Police, but then it
    was precisely the amateur spy who was the greatest danger
    of all. He did not know how long she had been looking at
    him, but perhaps for as much as five minutes, and it was
    possible that his features had not been perfectly under control.
    It was terribly dangerous to let your thoughts wander
    when you were in any public place or within range of a telescreen.
    The smallest thing could give you away. A nervous
    tic, an unconscious look of anxiety, a habit of muttering to
    yourself—anything that carried with it the suggestion of
    abnormality, of having something to hide. In any case, to
    wear an improper expression on your face (to look incredulous<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">不肯相信的；不能相信的；表示怀疑的not
    willing or not able to believe sth; showing an inability to believe sth</sub>
    when a victory was announced, for example) was itself
    a punishable offence. There was even a word for it in Newspeak: <strong>FACECRIME</strong>, it was called.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    The girl had turned her back on him again. Perhaps after
    all she was not really following him about, perhaps it was
    coincidence that she had sat so close to him two days running.
    His cigarette had gone out, and he laid it carefully on
    the edge of the table. He would finish smoking it after work,
    if he could keep the tobacco in it. Quite likely the person
    at the next table was a spy of the Thought Police, and quite
    likely he would be in the cellars of the Ministry of Love
    within three days, but a cigarette end must not be wasted.
    Syme had folded up his strip of paper and stowed<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">妥善放置；把…收好to put sth in a
    safe place</sub> it away in
    his pocket. Parsons had begun talking again.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Did I ever tell you, old boy,’ he said, chuckling round the
    stem of his pipe, ‘about the time when those two nippers
    of mine set fire to the old market-woman’s skirt because
    they saw her wrapping up sausages<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">香肠；腊肠a mixture of finely chopped meat,

    keen as mustard! That’s a first-rate training they give them

    you. Still, gives ‘em the right idea, eh?’

    At this moment the telescreen let out a piercing whistle.
    It was the signal to return to work. All three men sprang to
    their feet to join in the struggle round the lifts, and the
    remaining tobacco fell out of Winston’s cigarette.
