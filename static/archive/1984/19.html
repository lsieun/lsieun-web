<h2>episode</h2>

<p class="indented">
    He was lying on something that felt like a camp bed, except
    that it was higher off the ground and that he was
    fixed down in some way so that he could not move. Light
    that seemed stronger than usual was falling on his face.
    O’Brien was standing at his side, looking down at him intently.
    At the other side of him stood a man in a white coat,
    holding a hypodermic<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">皮下注射器 a medical instrument with a long thin needle that is used to give sb an injection under their skin</sub> syringe<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">注射器 a plastic or glass tube with a long hollow needle that is used for putting drugs, etc. into a person's body or for taking a small amount of blood from a person</sub>.

<p class="indented">
    Even after his eyes were open he took in his surroundings
    only gradually. He had the impression of swimming up
    into this room from some quite different world, a sort of
    underwater world far beneath it. How long he had been down
    there he did not know. Since the moment when they arrested
    him he had not seen darkness or daylight. Besides, his
    memories were not continuous. There had been times when
    consciousness, even the sort of consciousness that one has
    in sleep, had stopped dead and started again after a blank
    interval. But whether the intervals were of days or weeks or
    only seconds, there was no way of knowing.

<h2>episode: 回忆</h2>

<p class="indented">
    With that first blow on the elbow the nightmare had
    started. Later he was to realize that all that then happened
    was merely a preliminary, a routine interrogation<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">审问；审讯 the act or process of questioning somebody closely, often in an aggressive manner, especially as part of an official investigation or trial</sub> to which
    nearly all prisoners were subjected. There was a long range
    of crimes—espionage<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">间谍活动；谍报活动；刺探活动 the activity of secretly getting important political or military information about another country or of finding out another company's secrets by using spies</sub>, sabotage<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（为防止敌人利用或表示抗议而对设备、交通等进行的）蓄意毁坏，人为破坏the act of doing deliberate damage to equipment, transport, machines, etc. to prevent an enemy from using them, or to protest about sth</sub>, and the like—to which everyone
    had to confess as a matter of course. The confession
    was a formality<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">例行公事 a thing that you must do as part of an official process, but which has little meaning and will not affect what happens</sub>, though the torture was real. How many
    times he had been beaten, how long the beatings had continued,
    he could not remember. Always there were five or
    six men in black uniforms at him simultaneously. Sometimes
    it was fists, sometimes it was truncheons<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">警棍a short thick stick that police officers carry as a weapon</sub>, sometimes
    it was steel rods, sometimes it was boots. There were times
    when he rolled about the floor, as shameless as an animal,
    writhing<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（常指因剧痛不停地）扭动，翻滚 to twist or move your body without stopping, often because you are in great pain</sub> his body this way and that in an endless, hopeless
    effort to dodge the kicks, and simply inviting more and yet
    more kicks, in his ribs, in his belly, on his elbows, on his
    shins<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">胫；胫部the front part of the leg below the knee</sub>, in his groin<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">腹股沟；大腿根儿the part of the body where the legs join at the top including the area around the genitals (= sex organs)</sub>, in his testicles<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">睾丸 either of the two organs that produce sperm , located in a bag of skin below the penis</sub>, on the bone at the base
    of his spine<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">脊柱；脊椎 the row of small bones that are connected together down the middle of the back</sub>. There were times when it went on and on until
    the cruel, wicked, unforgivable thing seemed to him not
    that the guards continued to beat him but that he could not
    force himself into losing consciousness. There were times
    when his nerve so forsook him that he began shouting for
    mercy even before the beating began, when the mere sight
    of a fist drawn back for a blow was enough to make him
    pour forth a confession of real and imaginary crimes. There
    were other times when he started out with the resolve<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">决心；坚定的信念 strong determination to achieve sth</sub> of
    confessing nothing, when every word had to be forced out
    of him between gasps of pain, and there were times when he
    feebly<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">虚弱地,有气无力地</sub> tried to compromise, when he said to himself: ‘I will
    confess, but not yet. I must hold out till the pain becomes
    unbearable. Three more kicks, two more kicks, and then I
    will tell them what they want.’ Sometimes he was beaten till
    he could hardly stand, then flung like a sack of potatoes on
    to the stone floor of a cell, left to recuperate<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">康复；恢复；恢复健康 to get back your health, strength or energy after being ill/sick, tired, injured, etc.</sub> for a few hours,
    and then taken out and beaten again. There were also longer
    periods of recovery. He remembered them dimly, because
    they were spent chiefly in sleep or stupor<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（尤指由于醉酒、吸毒或惊吓而出现的）神志不清，恍惚，麻痹状态a state in which you are unable to think, hear, etc. clearly, especially because you have drunk too much alcohol, taken drugs or had a shock</sub>. He remembered
    a cell with a plank bed, a sort of shelf sticking out from the
    wall, and a tin wash-basin, and meals of hot soup and bread
    and sometimes coffee. He remembered a surly barber<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（为男子理发、修面的）理发师 a person whose job is to cut men's hair and sometimes to shave them</sub> arriving
    to scrape his chin and crop his hair, and businesslike,
    unsympathetic men in white coats feeling his pulse, tapping
    his reflexes, turning up his eyelids, running harsh fingers
    over him in search for broken bones, and shooting needles
    into his arm to make him sleep.
    <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：讲述Winston在过去几天内受到的身体上的毒打</sub>
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    The beatings grew less frequent, and became mainly a
    threat, a horror to which he could be sent back at any moment
    when his answers were unsatisfactory. His questioners
    now were not ruffians<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">暴徒；恶棍 a violent man, especially one who commits crimes</sub> in black uniforms but Party intellectuals,
    little rotund<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">圆胖的；肥圆的 having a fat round body</sub> men with quick movements and flashing
    spectacles, who worked on him in relays over periods which
    lasted—he thought, he could not be sure—ten or twelve
    hours at a stretch. These other questioners saw to it that he
    was in constant slight pain, but it was not chiefly pain that
    they relied on. They slapped his face, wrung his ears, pulled
    his hair, made him stand on one leg, refused him leave to
    urinate, shone glaring lights in his face until his eyes ran
    with water; but <strong>the aim of this was simply to humiliate him
    and destroy his power of arguing and reasoning.</strong> Their real
    weapon was the merciless questioning that went on and on,
    hour after hour, tripping him up, laying traps for him, twisting
    everything that he said, convicting him at every step of
    lies and self-contradiction until he began weeping as much
    from shame as from nervous fatigue. Sometimes he would
    weep half a dozen times in a single session. Most of the time
    they screamed abuse at him and threatened at every hesitation
    to deliver him over to the guards again; but sometimes
    they would suddenly change their tune, call him comrade,
    appeal to him in the name of Ingsoc and Big Brother, and
    ask him sorrowfully whether even now he had not enough
    loyalty to the Party left to make him wish to undo the evil
    he had done. When his nerves were in rags after hours of
    questioning, even this appeal could reduce him to snivelling
    tears. In the end the nagging<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">纠缠不休的；难以摆脱的 continuing for a long time and difficult to cure or remove</sub> voices broke him down
    more completely than the boots and fists of the guards. He
    became simply a mouth that uttered, a hand that signed,
    whatever was demanded of him. <strong>His sole concern was to
    find out what they wanted him to confess, and then confess
    it quickly, before the bullying started anew.</strong> He confessed
    to the assassination of eminent Party members, the distribution of
    seditious<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">煽动(性)的;扰乱治安的;煽动叛变的 involving or encouraging rebellion against a government or other authority</sub> pamphlets, embezzlement<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">侵吞公款</sub> of public
    funds, sale of military secrets, sabotage of every kind. He
    confessed that he had been a spy in the pay of the Eastasian
    government as far back as 1968.<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">笔记：如果当时是1984年，那么距离1968年已经16年了。</sub> He confessed that he
    was a religious believer, an admirer of capitalism, and a sexual pervert<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">性变态者 a person whose sexual behaviour is not thought to be normal or acceptable by most people</sub>.
    He confessed that he had murdered his wife,
    although he knew, and his questioners must have known,
    that his wife was still alive. He confessed that for years he
    had been in personal touch with Goldstein and had been
    a member of an underground organization which had included
    almost every human being he had ever known. It
    was easier to confess everything and implicate<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">牵涉，涉及（某人）to show or suggest that sb is involved in sth bad or criminal</sub> everybody.
    Besides, in a sense it was all true. It was true that he had
    been the enemy of the Party, and in the eyes of the Party
    there was no distinction between the thought and the deed.
    <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：讲述Winston在精神上受到的伤害</sub>
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    There were also memories of another kind. They stood
    out in his mind disconnectedly, like pictures with blackness all round them.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    He was in a cell which might have been either dark or
    light, because he could see nothing except a pair of eyes.
    Near at hand some kind of instrument was ticking slowly
    and regularly. The eyes grew larger and more luminous.
    Suddenly he floated out of his seat, dived into the eyes, and
    was swallowed up.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    He was strapped<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">用带子系（或捆、扎、扣）好 to fasten sb/sth in place using a strap or straps</sub> into a chair surrounded by dials, under
    dazzling lights. A man in a white coat was reading the dials.
    There was a tramp of heavy boots outside. The door clanged
    open. The waxed-faced officer marched in, followed by two
    guards.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Room 101,’ said the officer.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    The man in the white coat did not turn round. He did not
    look at Winston either; he was looking only at the dials.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    He was rolling down a mighty corridor, a kilometre
    wide, full of glorious, golden light, roaring with laughter
    and shouting out confessions at the top of his voice. He was
    confessing everything, even the things he had succeeded
    in holding back under the torture. <strong>He was relating the entire
    history of his life to an audience who knew it already.</strong>
    With him were the guards, the other questioners, the men
    in white coats, O’Brien, Julia, Mr Charrington, all rolling
    down the corridor together and shouting with laughter.
    Some dreadful thing which had lain embedded in the future
    had somehow been skipped over and had not happened.
    <strong>Everything was all right, there was no more pain, the last
    detail of his life was laid bare<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">揭露；说出</sub>, understood, forgiven.</strong>

<h2>episode: 回归现实</h2>

<p class="indented">
    He was starting up from the plank<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">木板；板条 a long narrow flat piece of wood that is used for making floors, etc.</sub> bed in the half-certainty
    that he had heard O’Brien’s voice. All through his
    interrogation, although he had never seen him, he had had
    the feeling that O’Brien was at his elbow, just out of sight. It
    was O’Brien who was directing everything. It was he who
    set the guards on to Winston and who prevented them from
    killing him. It was he who decided when Winston should
    scream with pain, when he should have a respite<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">短暂的延缓；喘息 a short delay allowed before sth difficult or unpleasant must be done</sub>, when he
    should be fed, when he should sleep, when the drugs should
    be pumped into his arm.<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">笔记：O’Brien在拷问Winston，但我觉得，后续剧情中，Winston还会变得感激O’Brien</sub> It was he who asked the questions
    and suggested the answers. He was the tormentor, he
    was the protector, he was the inquisitor, he was the friend.
    And once—Winston could not remember whether it was
    in drugged sleep, or in normal sleep, or even in a moment
    of wakefulness—a voice murmured in his ear: ‘Don’t worry, Winston;
    you are in my keeping. For seven years I have
    watched over you. Now the turning-point has come. I shall
    save you, I shall make you perfect.’ He was not sure whether
    it was O’Brien’s voice; but it was the same voice that had
    said to him, ‘We shall meet in the place where there is no
    darkness,’ in that other dream, seven years ago.
    <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：讲述Winston被O’Brien拷问</sub>
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    He did not remember any ending to his interrogation.
    There was a period of blackness and then the cell, or room,
    in which he now was had gradually materialized round him.
    He was almost flat on his back, and unable to move. His
    body was held down at every essential point. Even the back
    of his head was gripped in some manner. O’Brien was looking
    down at him gravely and rather sadly. His face, seen
    from below, looked coarse and worn, with pouches under
    the eyes and tired lines from nose to chin. He was older
    than Winston had thought him; he was perhaps forty-eight
    or fifty. Under his hand there was a dial with a lever on top
    and figures running round the face.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘I told you,’ said O’Brien, ‘that if we met again it would be here.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Yes,’ said Winston.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Without any warning except a slight movement of
    O’Brien’s hand, a wave of pain flooded his body. It was a
    frightening pain, because he could not see what was happening,
    and he had the feeling that some mortal injury was
    being done to him. He did not know whether the thing was
    really happening, or whether the effect was electrically
    produced; but his body was being wrenched out of shape, the
    joints were being slowly torn apart. Although the pain had
    brought the sweat out on his forehead, the worst of all was
    the fear that his backbone was about to snap. He set his
    teeth and breathed hard through his nose, trying to keep
    silent as long as possible.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘You are afraid,’ said O’Brien, watching his face, ‘that in
    another moment something is going to break. Your especial
    fear is that it will be your backbone. You have a vivid mental
    picture of the vertebrae snapping apart and the spinal fluid
    dripping out of them. That is what you are thinking, is it
    not, Winston?’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Winston did not answer. O’Brien drew back the lever on
    the dial. The wave of pain receded almost as quickly as it
    had come.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘That was forty,’ said O’Brien. ‘You can see that the numbers
    on this dial run up to a hundred. Will you please
    remember, throughout our conversation, that I have it in
    my power to inflict pain on you at any moment and to whatever
    degree I choose? If you tell me any lies, or attempt to
    prevaricate<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">支吾搪塞；闪烁其词；吞吞吐吐 to avoid giving a direct answer to a question in order to hide the truth</sub> in any way, or even fall below your usual level
    of intelligence, you will cry out with pain, instantly. Do you
    understand that?’
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Yes,’ said Winston.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    O’Brien’s manner became less severe. He resettled his
    spectacles thoughtfully, and took a pace or two up and
    down. When he spoke his voice was gentle and patient. He
    had the air of a doctor, a teacher, even a priest, anxious to
    explain and persuade rather than to punish.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘I am taking trouble with you, Winston,’ he said, ‘because
    you are worth trouble. You know perfectly well what is the
    matter with you. You have known it for years, though you
    have fought against the knowledge. You are mentally deranged.
    You suffer from a defective memory. You are unable
    to remember real events and you persuade yourself that you
    remember other events which never happened. Fortunately
    it is curable. You have never cured yourself of it, because
    you did not choose to. There was a small effort of the will
    that you were not ready to make. Even now, I am well aware,
    you are clinging to your disease under the impression that
    it is a virtue. Now we will take an example. At this moment,
    which power is Oceania at war with?’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘When I was arrested, Oceania was at war with Eastasia.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘With Eastasia. Good. And Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia, has it not?’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Winston drew in his breath. He opened his mouth to
    speak and then did not speak. He could not take his eyes
    away from the dial.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘The truth, please, Winston. YOUR truth. Tell me what you think you remember.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘I remember that until only a week before I was arrested,
    we were not at war with Eastasia at all. We were in alliance
    with them. The war was against Eurasia. That had lasted for
    four years. Before that——’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    O’Brien stopped him with a movement of the hand.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Another example,’ he said. ‘Some years ago you had a
    very serious delusion indeed. You believed that three men,
    three one-time Party members named Jones, Aaronson,
    and Rutherford—men who were executed for treachery
    and sabotage after making the fullest possible confession—
    were not guilty of the crimes they were charged with. You
    believed that you had seen unmistakable documentary evi-
    dence proving that their confessions were false. There was
    a certain photograph about which you had a hallucination.
    You believed that you had actually held it in your hands. It
    was a photograph something like this.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    An oblong<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">长方形的 used to describe any shape that is longer than it is wide</sub> slip of newspaper had appeared between
    O’Brien’s fingers. For perhaps five seconds it was within the
    angle of Winston’s vision. It was a photograph, and there
    was no question of its identity. It was THE photograph. It
    was another copy of the photograph of Jones, Aaronson,
    and Rutherford at the party function in New York, which
    he had chanced upon<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">笔记：chance on 碰巧遇见 to find or encounter somebody or something unexpectedly</sub> eleven years ago and promptly destroyed.
    For only an instant it was before his eyes, then it
    was out of sight again. But he had seen it, unquestionably he
    had seen it! He made a desperate, agonizing effort to wrench
    the top half of his body free. It was impossible to move so
    much as a centimetre in any direction. For the moment he
    had even forgotten the dial. All he wanted was to hold the
    photograph in his fingers again, or at least to see it.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘It exists!’ he cried.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘No,’ said O’Brien.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    He stepped across the room. There was a memory hole in the opposite wall. O’Brien lifted the grating.
    Unseen, the frail slip of paper was whirling away on the current of warm air; it was vanishing in a flash of flame.
    O’Brien turned away from the wall.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Ashes,’ he said. ‘Not even identifiable ashes. Dust. It does not exist. It never existed.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘But it did exist! It does exist! It exists in memory. I remember it. You remember it.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘I do not remember it,’ said O’Brien.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Winston’s heart sank. That was doublethink. He had a feeling of deadly helplessness.
    If he could have been certain that O’Brien was lying, it would not have seemed to matter.
    But it was perfectly possible that O’Brien had really forgotten the photograph.
    And if so, then already he would have forgotten his denial of remembering it, and forgotten the act of forgetting.
    How could one be sure that it was simple trickery?
    Perhaps that lunatic dislocation in the mind could really happen: that was the thought that defeated him.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    O’Brien was looking down at him speculatively<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">思索地</sub>.
    More than ever he had the air of a teacher taking pains with a wayward<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">难以控制的；任性的；倔强的 difficult to control</sub> but promising child.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘There is a Party slogan dealing with the control of the past,’ he said. ‘Repeat it, if you please.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘<strong>Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past</strong>,’ repeated Winston obediently.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Who controls the present controls the past,’ said O’Brien, nodding his head with slow approval. ‘Is it your opinion, Winston, that the past has real existence?’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Again the feeling of helplessness descended upon Winston.
    His eyes flitted towards the dial.
    He not only did not know whether ‘yes’ or ‘no’ was the answer that would save him from pain;
    he did not even know which answer he believed to be the true one.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    O’Brien smiled faintly. ‘You are no metaphysician<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">形而上学家 a scholar who specializes in the branch of philosophy concerned with the study of the nature of being, existence, time and space, and causality</sub>, Winston,’ he said.
    ‘Until this moment you had never considered what is meant by existence.
    I will put it more precisely. Does the past exist concretely, in space?
    Is there somewhere or other a place, a world of solid objects, where the past is still happening?’
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘No.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Then where does the past exist, if at all?’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘In records. It is written down.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘In records. And——?’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘In the mind. In human memories.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘In memory. Very well, then. We, the Party, control all records, and we control all memories.
    Then we control the past, do we not?’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘But how can you stop people remembering things?’ cried Winston again momentarily forgetting the dial.
    ‘It is involuntary. It is outside oneself. How can you control memory? You have not controlled mine!’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    O’Brien’s manner grew stern again. He laid his hand on the dial.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘On the contrary,’ he said, ‘YOU have not controlled it. That is what has brought you here.
    You are here because you have failed in humility<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">谦逊；谦虚 the quality of not thinking that you are better than other people; the quality of being humble</sub>, in self-discipline.
    You would not make the act of submission which is the price of sanity.
    You preferred to be a lunatic, a minority of one.
    Only the disciplined mind can see reality, Winston.
    You believe that reality is something objective, external, existing in its own right.
    You also believe that the nature of reality is self-evident.
    When you delude yourself into thinking that you see something, you assume that everyone else sees the same thing as you.
    But I tell you, Winston, that reality is not external.
    Reality exists in the human mind, and nowhere else.
    Not in the individual mind, which can make mistakes, and in any case soon perishes: only in the mind of the Party, which is collective and immortal.
    Whatever the Party holds to be the truth, is truth.
    It is impossible to see reality except by looking through the eyes of the Party.
    That is the fact that you have got to relearn, Winston.
    It needs an act of self-destruction, an effort of the will.
    You must humble yourself before you can become sane.’

<p class="indented">
    He paused for a few moments, as though to allow what he had been saying to sink in.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Do you remember,’ he went on, ‘writing in your diary, ‘<strong>Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four</strong>’?’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Yes,’ said Winston.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    O’Brien held up his left hand, its back towards Winston, with the thumb hidden and the four fingers extended.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘How many fingers am I holding up, Winston?’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Four.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘And if the party says that it is not four but five—then how many?’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Four.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    The word ended in a gasp<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（尤指由于惊讶或疼痛而）喘气，喘息，倒抽气 to take a quick deep breath with your mouth open, especially because you are surprised or in pain</sub> of pain.
    The needle of the dial had shot up to fifty-five.
    The sweat had sprung out all over Winston’s body.
    The air tore into his lungs and issued again in deep groans which even by clenching his teeth he could not stop.
    O’Brien watched him, the four fingers still extended.
    He drew back the lever. This time the pain was only slightly eased.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘How many fingers, Winston?’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Four.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    The needle went up to sixty.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘How many fingers, Winston?’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Four! Four! What else can I say? Four!’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    The needle must have risen again, but he did not look at it.
    The heavy, stern face and the four fingers filled his vision.
    The fingers stood up before his eyes like pillars, enormous, blurry, and seeming to vibrate, but unmistakably four.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘How many fingers, Winston?’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Four! Stop it, stop it! How can you go on? Four! Four!’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘How many fingers, Winston?’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Five! Five! Five!’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘No, Winston, that is no use. You are lying. You still think there are four. How many fingers, please?’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Four! five! Four! Anything you like. Only stop it, stop the pain!’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Abruptly he was sitting up with O’Brien’s arm round his shoulders.
    He had perhaps lost consciousness for a few seconds.
    The bonds that had held his body down were loosened.
    He felt very cold, he was shaking uncontrollably, his teeth were chattering, the tears were rolling down his cheeks.
    For a moment he clung to O’Brien like a baby, curiously comforted by the heavy arm round his shoulders.
    He had the feeling that O’Brien was his protector, that the pain was something that came from outside, from some other source,
    and that it was O’Brien who would save him from it.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘You are a slow learner, Winston,’ said O’Brien gently.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘How can I help it?’ he blubbered.<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">blubber 大声哭 to cry noisily</sub>
    ‘How can I help seeing what is in front of my eyes? Two and two are four.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Sometimes, Winston. Sometimes they are five. Sometimes they are three. Sometimes they are all of them at once.
    You must try harder. It is not easy to become sane.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    He laid Winston down on the bed.
    The grip of his limbs tightened again, but the pain had ebbed away and the trembling had stopped, leaving him merely weak and cold.
    O’Brien motioned with his head to the man in the white coat, who had stood immobile throughout the proceedings.
    The man in the white coat bent down and looked closely into Winston’s eyes, felt his pulse,
    laid an ear against his chest, tapped here and there, then he nodded to O’Brien.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Again,’ said O’Brien.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    The pain flowed into Winston’s body.
    The needle must be at seventy, seventy-five.
    He had shut his eyes this time.
    He knew that the fingers were still there, and still four.
    All that mattered was somehow to stay alive until the spasm was over.
    He had ceased to notice whether he was crying out or not.
    The pain lessened again. He opened his eyes.
    O’Brien had drawn back the lever.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘How many fingers, Winston?’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Four. I suppose there are four. I would see five if I could. I am trying to see five.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Which do you wish: to persuade me that you see five, or really to see them?’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Really to see them.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Again,’ said O’Brien.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Perhaps the needle was eighty—ninety.
    Winston could not intermittently remember why the pain was happening.
    Behind his screwed-up eyelids a forest of fingers seemed to be moving in a sort of dance, weaving in and out, disappearing behind one another and reappearing again.
    He was trying to count them, he could not remember why.
    He knew only that it was impossible to count them, and that this was somehow due to the mysterious identity between five and four.
    The pain died down again.
    When he opened his eyes it was to find that he was still seeing the same thing.
    Innumerable fingers, like moving trees, were still streaming past in either direction, crossing and recrossing.
    He shut his eyes again.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘How many fingers am I holding up, Winston?’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘I don’t know. I don’t know. You will kill me if you do that again. Four, five, six—in all honesty I don’t know.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Better,’ said O’Brien.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    A needle slid into Winston’s arm.
    Almost in the same instant a blissful, healing warmth spread all through his body.
    The pain was already half-forgotten.
    He opened his eyes and looked up gratefully at O’Brien.
    At sight of the heavy, lined face, so ugly and so intelligent, his heart seemed to turn over.
    If he could have moved he would have stretched out a hand and laid it on O’Brien’s arm.
    He had never loved him so deeply as at this moment, and not merely because he had stopped the pain.
    The old feeling, that at bottom it did not matter whether O’Brien was a friend or an enemy, had come back.
    O’Brien was a person who could be talked to.
    Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood.
    O’Brien had tortured him to the edge of lunacy, and in a little while, it was certain, he would send him to his death.
    It made no difference.
    In some sense that went deeper than friendship, they were intimates:
    somewhere or other, although the actual words might never be spoken, there was a place where they could meet and talk.
    O’Brien was looking down at him with an expression which suggested that the same thought might be in his own mind.
    When he spoke it was in an easy, conversational tone.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Do you know where you are, Winston?’ he said.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘I don’t know. I can guess. In the Ministry of Love.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Do you know how long you have been here?’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘I don’t know. Days, weeks, months—I think it is months.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘And why do you imagine that we bring people to this place?’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘To make them confess.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘No, that is not the reason. Try again.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘To punish them.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘No!’ exclaimed O’Brien. His voice had changed extraordinarily, and his face had suddenly become both stern and animated.
    ‘No! Not merely to extract your confession, not to punish you. Shall I tell you why we have brought you here?
    To cure you! To make you sane! Will you understand, Winston, that no one whom we bring to this place ever leaves our hands uncured?
    We are not interested in those stupid crimes that you have committed.
    The Party is not interested in the overt act: the thought is all we care about.
    We do not merely destroy our enemies, we change them. Do you understand what I mean by that?’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    He was bending over Winston.
    His face looked enormous because of its nearness, and hideously ugly because it was seen from below.
    Moreover it was filled with a sort of exaltation, a lunatic intensity.
    Again Winston’s heart shrank.
    If it had been possible he would have cowered deeper into the bed.
    He felt certain that O’Brien was about to twist the dial out of sheer wantonness.
    At this moment, however, O’Brien turned away. He took a pace or two up and down.
    Then he continued less vehemently:
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘The first thing for you to understand is that in this place there are no martyrdoms<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">殉难；殉道 the suffering or death of a martyr</sub>.
    You have read of the religious persecutions of the past.
    In the Middle Ages there was the Inquisitlon. It was a failure.
    It set out to eradicate heresy, and ended by perpetuating it.
    For every heretic it burned at the stake, thousands of others rose up. Why was that?
    Because the Inquisition killed its enemies in the open, and killed them while they were still unrepentant<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">不思悔改的；不悔悟的；顽固不化的 showing no shame about your actions or beliefs</sub>:
    in fact, it killed them because they were unrepentant.
    Men were dying because they would not abandon their true beliefs.
    Naturally all the glory belonged to the victim and all the shame to the Inquisitor who burned him.
    Later, in the twentieth century, there were the totalitarians, as they were called.
    There were the German Nazis and the Russian Communists.
    The Russians persecuted heresy more cruelly than the Inquisition had done.
    And they imagined that they had learned from the mistakes of the past; they knew, at any rate, that one must not make martyrs.
    Before they exposed their victims to public trial, they deliberately set themselves to destroy their dignity.
    They wore them down by torture and solitude until they were despicable, cringing wretches, confessing whatever was put into their mouths,
    covering themselves with abuse, accusing and sheltering behind one another, whimpering for mercy.
    And yet after only a few years the same thing had happened over again.
    The dead men had become martyrs and their degradation was forgotten.
    Once again, why was it? In the first place, because the confessions that they had made were obviously extorted and untrue.
    We do not make mistakes of that kind. All the confessions that are uttered here are true. We make them true.
    And above all we do not allow the dead to rise up against us.
    You must stop imagining that posterity will vindicate<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">澄清（责难或嫌疑）；证明（某人）无罪（责） to prove that sb is not guilty when they have been accused of doing sth wrong or illegal</sub> you, Winston.
    Posterity will never hear of you. You will be lifted clean out from the stream of history.
    We shall turn you into gas and pour you into the stratosphere<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">平流层 the layer of the earth's atmosphere between about 10 and 50 kilometres above the surface of the earth</sub>.
    Nothing will remain of you, not a name in a register, not a memory in a living brain.
    You will be annihilated in the past as well as in the future. You will never have existed.’
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Then why bother to torture me? thought Winston, with a momentary bitterness.
    O’Brien checked his step as though Winston had uttered the thought aloud.
    His large ugly face came nearer, with the eyes a little narrowed.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘You are thinking,’ he said, ‘that since we intend to destroy you utterly,
    so that nothing that you say or do can make the smallest difference—in that case,
    why do we go to the trouble of interrogating you first?
    That is what you were thinking, was it not?’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Yes,’ said Winston.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    O’Brien smiled slightly. ‘You are a flaw in the pattern, Winston. You are a stain that must be wiped out.
    Did I not tell you just now that we are different from the persecutors of the past?
    We are not content with negative obedience, nor even with the most abject<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">下贱的；卑躬屈节的；自卑的 without any pride or respect for yourself</sub> submission<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">屈服；投降；归顺 the act of accepting that sb has defeated you and that you must obey them</sub>.
    When finally you surrender to us, it must be of your own free will.
    We do not destroy the heretic because he resists us: so long as he resists us we never destroy him.
    We convert him, we capture his inner mind, we reshape him.
    We burn all evil and all illusion out of him; we bring him over to our side, not in appearance, but genuinely, heart and soul.
    We make him one of ourselves before we kill him. It is intolerable to us that an erroneous thought should exist anywhere in the world,
    however secret and powerless it may be.
    Even in the instant of death we cannot permit any deviation.
    In the old days the heretic walked to the stake still a heretic, proclaiming his heresy, exulting in it.
    Even the victim of the Russian purges could carry rebellion locked up in his skull as he walked down the passage waiting for the bullet.
    But we make the brain perfect before we blow it out.
    The command of the old despotisms was ‘Thou shalt not”.
    The command of the totalitarians was ‘Thou shalt”.
    Our command is ‘THOU ART”.
    No one whom we bring to this place ever stands out against us. Everyone is washed clean.
    Even those three miserable traitors in whose innocence you once believed—Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford—in the end we broke them down.
    I took part in their interrogation myself. I saw them gradually worn down, whimpering<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">抽泣；呜咽；啜泣；泣诉；抽搭着说 to make low, weak crying noises; to speak in this way</sub>, grovelling<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">卑躬屈膝；俯首贴耳；奴颜婢膝 to behave in a very humble way towards sb who is more important than you or who can give you sth you want</sub>, weeping<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（通常因悲伤）哭泣，流泪 to cry, usually because you are sad</sub>—and in the end it was not with pain or fear, only with penitence<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">忏悔；悔罪；愧疚 a feeling of being sorry because you have done sth wrong</sub>.
    By the time we had finished with them they were only the shells of men.
    There was nothing left in them except sorrow for what they had done, and love of Big Brother.
    It was touching to see how they loved him.
    They begged to be shot quickly, so that they could die while their minds were still clean.’
