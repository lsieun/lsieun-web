<h2>episode</h2>

<p class="indented">
    He was lying on something that felt like a camp bed, except
    that it was higher off the ground and that he was
    fixed down in some way so that he could not move. Light
    that seemed stronger than usual was falling on his face.
    O’Brien was standing at his side, looking down at him intently.
    At the other side of him stood a man in a white coat,
    holding a hypodermic<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">皮下注射器 a medical instrument with a long thin needle that is used to give sb an injection under their skin</sub> syringe<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">注射器 a plastic or glass tube with a long hollow needle that is used for putting drugs, etc. into a person's body or for taking a small amount of blood from a person</sub>.

    Even after his eyes were open he took in his surroundings
    only gradually. He had the impression of swimming up
    into this room from some quite different world, a sort of
    underwater world far beneath it. How long he had been down
    there he did not know. Since the moment when they arrested
    him he had not seen darkness or daylight. Besides, his
    memories were not continuous. There had been times when
    consciousness, even the sort of consciousness that one has
    in sleep, had stopped dead and started again after a blank
    interval. But whether the intervals were of days or weeks or
    only seconds, there was no way of knowing.

    With that first blow on the elbow the nightmare had
    started. Later he was to realize that all that then happened
    was merely a preliminary, a routine interrogation<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">审问；审讯 the act or process of questioning somebody closely, often in an aggressive manner, especially as part of an official investigation or trial</sub> to which
    nearly all prisoners were subjected. There was a long range
    of crimes—espionage<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">间谍活动；谍报活动；刺探活动 the activity of secretly getting important political or military information about another country or of finding out another company's secrets by using spies</sub>, sabotage<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（为防止敌人利用或表示抗议而对设备、交通等进行的）蓄意毁坏，人为破坏the act of doing deliberate damage to equipment, transport, machines, etc. to prevent an enemy from using them, or to protest about sth</sub>, and the like—to which everyone
    had to confess as a matter of course. The confession
    was a formality<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">例行公事 a thing that you must do as part of an official process, but which has little meaning and will not affect what happens</sub>, though the torture was real. How many
    times he had been beaten, how long the beatings had continued,
    he could not remember. Always there were five or
    six men in black uniforms at him simultaneously. Sometimes
    it was fists, sometimes it was truncheons<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">警棍a short thick stick that police officers carry as a weapon</sub>, sometimes
    it was steel rods, sometimes it was boots. There were times
    when he rolled about the floor, as shameless as an animal,
    writhing<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（常指因剧痛不停地）扭动，翻滚 to twist or move your body without stopping, often because you are in great pain</sub> his body this way and that in an endless, hopeless
    effort to dodge the kicks, and simply inviting more and yet
    more kicks, in his ribs, in his belly, on his elbows, on his
    shins<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">胫；胫部the front part of the leg below the knee</sub>, in his groin<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">腹股沟；大腿根儿the part of the body where the legs join at the top including the area around the genitals (= sex organs)</sub>, in his testicles<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">睾丸 either of the two organs that produce sperm , located in a bag of skin below the penis</sub>, on the bone at the base
    of his spine<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">脊柱；脊椎 the row of small bones that are connected together down the middle of the back</sub>. There were times when it went on and on until
    the cruel, wicked, unforgivable thing seemed to him not
    that the guards continued to beat him but that he could not
    force himself into losing consciousness. There were times
    when his nerve so forsook him that he began shouting for
    mercy even before the beating began, when the mere sight
    of a fist drawn back for a blow was enough to make him
    pour forth a confession of real and imaginary crimes. There
    were other times when he started out with the resolve<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">决心；坚定的信念 strong determination to achieve sth</sub> of
    confessing nothing, when every word had to be forced out
    of him between gasps of pain, and there were times when he
    feebly<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">虚弱地,有气无力地</sub> tried to compromise, when he said to himself: ‘I will
    confess, but not yet. I must hold out till the pain becomes
    unbearable. Three more kicks, two more kicks, and then I
    will tell them what they want.’ Sometimes he was beaten till
    he could hardly stand, then flung like a sack of potatoes on
    to the stone floor of a cell, left to recuperate<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">康复；恢复；恢复健康 to get back your health, strength or energy after being ill/sick, tired, injured, etc.</sub> for a few hours,
    and then taken out and beaten again. There were also longer
    periods of recovery. He remembered them dimly, because
    they were spent chiefly in sleep or stupor<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（尤指由于醉酒、吸毒或惊吓而出现的）神志不清，恍惚，麻痹状态a state in which you are unable to think, hear, etc. clearly, especially because you have drunk too much alcohol, taken drugs or had a shock</sub>. He remembered
    a cell with a plank bed, a sort of shelf sticking out from the
    wall, and a tin wash-basin, and meals of hot soup and bread
    and sometimes coffee. He remembered a surly barber<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（为男子理发、修面的）理发师 a person whose job is to cut men's hair and sometimes to shave them</sub> arriving
    to scrape his chin and crop his hair, and businesslike,
    unsympathetic men in white coats feeling his pulse, tapping
    his reflexes, turning up his eyelids, running harsh fingers
    over him in search for broken bones, and shooting needles
    into his arm to make him sleep.
