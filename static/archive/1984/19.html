<h2>episode</h2>

<p class="indented">
    He was lying on something that felt like a camp bed, except
    that it was higher off the ground and that he was
    fixed down in some way so that he could not move. Light
    that seemed stronger than usual was falling on his face.
    O’Brien was standing at his side, looking down at him intently.
    At the other side of him stood a man in a white coat,
    holding a hypodermic<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">皮下注射器 a medical instrument with a long thin needle that is used to give sb an injection under their skin</sub> syringe<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">注射器 a plastic or glass tube with a long hollow needle that is used for putting drugs, etc. into a person's body or for taking a small amount of blood from a person</sub>.

    Even after his eyes were open he took in his surroundings
    only gradually. He had the impression of swimming up
    into this room from some quite different world, a sort of
    underwater world far beneath it. How long he had been down
    there he did not know. Since the moment when they arrested
    him he had not seen darkness or daylight. Besides, his
    memories were not continuous. There had been times when
    consciousness, even the sort of consciousness that one has
    in sleep, had stopped dead and started again after a blank
    interval. But whether the intervals were of days or weeks or
    only seconds, there was no way of knowing.

<h2>episode: 回忆</h2>

<p class="indented">
    With that first blow on the elbow the nightmare had
    started. Later he was to realize that all that then happened
    was merely a preliminary, a routine interrogation<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">审问；审讯 the act or process of questioning somebody closely, often in an aggressive manner, especially as part of an official investigation or trial</sub> to which
    nearly all prisoners were subjected. There was a long range
    of crimes—espionage<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">间谍活动；谍报活动；刺探活动 the activity of secretly getting important political or military information about another country or of finding out another company's secrets by using spies</sub>, sabotage<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（为防止敌人利用或表示抗议而对设备、交通等进行的）蓄意毁坏，人为破坏the act of doing deliberate damage to equipment, transport, machines, etc. to prevent an enemy from using them, or to protest about sth</sub>, and the like—to which everyone
    had to confess as a matter of course. The confession
    was a formality<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">例行公事 a thing that you must do as part of an official process, but which has little meaning and will not affect what happens</sub>, though the torture was real. How many
    times he had been beaten, how long the beatings had continued,
    he could not remember. Always there were five or
    six men in black uniforms at him simultaneously. Sometimes
    it was fists, sometimes it was truncheons<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">警棍a short thick stick that police officers carry as a weapon</sub>, sometimes
    it was steel rods, sometimes it was boots. There were times
    when he rolled about the floor, as shameless as an animal,
    writhing<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（常指因剧痛不停地）扭动，翻滚 to twist or move your body without stopping, often because you are in great pain</sub> his body this way and that in an endless, hopeless
    effort to dodge the kicks, and simply inviting more and yet
    more kicks, in his ribs, in his belly, on his elbows, on his
    shins<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">胫；胫部the front part of the leg below the knee</sub>, in his groin<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">腹股沟；大腿根儿the part of the body where the legs join at the top including the area around the genitals (= sex organs)</sub>, in his testicles<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">睾丸 either of the two organs that produce sperm , located in a bag of skin below the penis</sub>, on the bone at the base
    of his spine<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">脊柱；脊椎 the row of small bones that are connected together down the middle of the back</sub>. There were times when it went on and on until
    the cruel, wicked, unforgivable thing seemed to him not
    that the guards continued to beat him but that he could not
    force himself into losing consciousness. There were times
    when his nerve so forsook him that he began shouting for
    mercy even before the beating began, when the mere sight
    of a fist drawn back for a blow was enough to make him
    pour forth a confession of real and imaginary crimes. There
    were other times when he started out with the resolve<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">决心；坚定的信念 strong determination to achieve sth</sub> of
    confessing nothing, when every word had to be forced out
    of him between gasps of pain, and there were times when he
    feebly<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">虚弱地,有气无力地</sub> tried to compromise, when he said to himself: ‘I will
    confess, but not yet. I must hold out till the pain becomes
    unbearable. Three more kicks, two more kicks, and then I
    will tell them what they want.’ Sometimes he was beaten till
    he could hardly stand, then flung like a sack of potatoes on
    to the stone floor of a cell, left to recuperate<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">康复；恢复；恢复健康 to get back your health, strength or energy after being ill/sick, tired, injured, etc.</sub> for a few hours,
    and then taken out and beaten again. There were also longer
    periods of recovery. He remembered them dimly, because
    they were spent chiefly in sleep or stupor<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（尤指由于醉酒、吸毒或惊吓而出现的）神志不清，恍惚，麻痹状态a state in which you are unable to think, hear, etc. clearly, especially because you have drunk too much alcohol, taken drugs or had a shock</sub>. He remembered
    a cell with a plank bed, a sort of shelf sticking out from the
    wall, and a tin wash-basin, and meals of hot soup and bread
    and sometimes coffee. He remembered a surly barber<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（为男子理发、修面的）理发师 a person whose job is to cut men's hair and sometimes to shave them</sub> arriving
    to scrape his chin and crop his hair, and businesslike,
    unsympathetic men in white coats feeling his pulse, tapping
    his reflexes, turning up his eyelids, running harsh fingers
    over him in search for broken bones, and shooting needles
    into his arm to make him sleep.

</p>

<p class="indented">
    The beatings grew less frequent, and became mainly a
    threat, a horror to which he could be sent back at any moment
    when his answers were unsatisfactory. His questioners
    now were not ruffians<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">暴徒；恶棍 a violent man, especially one who commits crimes</sub> in black uniforms but Party intellectuals,
    little rotund<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">圆胖的；肥圆的 having a fat round body</sub> men with quick movements and flashing
    spectacles, who worked on him in relays over periods which
    lasted—he thought, he could not be sure—ten or twelve
    hours at a stretch. These other questioners saw to it that he
    was in constant slight pain, but it was not chiefly pain that
    they relied on. They slapped his face, wrung his ears, pulled
    his hair, made him stand on one leg, refused him leave to
    urinate, shone glaring lights in his face until his eyes ran
    with water; but <strong>the aim of this was simply to humiliate him
    and destroy his power of arguing and reasoning.</strong> Their real
    weapon was the merciless questioning that went on and on,
    hour after hour, tripping him up, laying traps for him, twisting
    everything that he said, convicting him at every step of
    lies and self-contradiction until he began weeping as much
    from shame as from nervous fatigue. Sometimes he would
    weep half a dozen times in a single session. Most of the time
    they screamed abuse at him and threatened at every hesitation
    to deliver him over to the guards again; but sometimes
    they would suddenly change their tune, call him comrade,
    appeal to him in the name of Ingsoc and Big Brother, and
    ask him sorrowfully whether even now he had not enough
    loyalty to the Party left to make him wish to undo the evil
    he had done. When his nerves were in rags after hours of
    questioning, even this appeal could reduce him to snivelling
    tears. In the end the nagging<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">纠缠不休的；难以摆脱的 continuing for a long time and difficult to cure or remove</sub> voices broke him down
    more completely than the boots and fists of the guards. He
    became simply a mouth that uttered, a hand that signed,
    whatever was demanded of him. <strong>His sole concern was to
    find out what they wanted him to confess, and then confess
    it quickly, before the bullying started anew.</strong> He confessed
    to the assassination of eminent Party members, the distribution of
    seditious<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">煽动(性)的;扰乱治安的;煽动叛变的 involving or encouraging rebellion against a government or other authority</sub> pamphlets, embezzlement<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">侵吞公款</sub> of public
    funds, sale of military secrets, sabotage of every kind. He
    confessed that he had been a spy in the pay of the Eastasian
    government as far back as 1968.<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">笔记：如果当时是1984年，那么距离1968年已经16年了。</sub> He confessed that he
    was a religious believer, an admirer of capitalism, and a sexual pervert<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">性变态者 a person whose sexual behaviour is not thought to be normal or acceptable by most people</sub>.
    He confessed that he had murdered his wife,
    although he knew, and his questioners must have known,
    that his wife was still alive. He confessed that for years he
    had been in personal touch with Goldstein and had been
    a member of an underground organization which had included
    almost every human being he had ever known. It
    was easier to confess everything and implicate<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">牵涉，涉及（某人）to show or suggest that sb is involved in sth bad or criminal</sub> everybody.
    Besides, in a sense it was all true. It was true that he had
    been the enemy of the Party, and in the eyes of the Party
    there was no distinction between the thought and the deed.

</p>

<p class="indented">
    There were also memories of another kind. They stood
    out in his mind disconnectedly, like pictures with blackness all round them.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    He was in a cell which might have been either dark or
    light, because he could see nothing except a pair of eyes.
    Near at hand some kind of instrument was ticking slowly
    and regularly. The eyes grew larger and more luminous.
    Suddenly he floated out of his seat, dived into the eyes, and
    was swallowed up.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    He was strapped<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">用带子系（或捆、扎、扣）好 to fasten sb/sth in place using a strap or straps</sub> into a chair surrounded by dials, under
    dazzling lights. A man in a white coat was reading the dials.
    There was a tramp of heavy boots outside. The door clanged
    open. The waxed-faced officer marched in, followed by two
    guards.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Room 101,’ said the officer.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    The man in the white coat did not turn round. He did not
    look at Winston either; he was looking only at the dials.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    He was rolling down a mighty corridor, a kilometre
    wide, full of glorious, golden light, roaring with laughter
    and shouting out confessions at the top of his voice. He was
    confessing everything, even the things he had succeeded
    in holding back under the torture. <strong>He was relating the entire
    history of his life to an audience who knew it already.</strong>
    With him were the guards, the other questioners, the men
    in white coats, O’Brien, Julia, Mr Charrington, all rolling
    down the corridor together and shouting with laughter.
    Some dreadful thing which had lain embedded in the future
    had somehow been skipped over and had not happened.
    <strong>Everything was all right, there was no more pain, the last
    detail of his life was laid bare<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">揭露；说出</sub>, understood, forgiven.</strong>

<h2>episode: 回归现实</h2>

<p class="indented">
    He was starting up from the plank<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">木板；板条 a long narrow flat piece of wood that is used for making floors, etc.</sub> bed in the half-certainty
    that he had heard O’Brien’s voice. All through his
    interrogation, although he had never seen him, he had had
    the feeling that O’Brien was at his elbow, just out of sight. It
    was O’Brien who was directing everything. It was he who
    set the guards on to Winston and who prevented them from
    killing him. It was he who decided when Winston should
    scream with pain, when he should have a respite<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">短暂的延缓；喘息 a short delay allowed before sth difficult or unpleasant must be done</sub>, when he
    should be fed, when he should sleep, when the drugs should
    be pumped into his arm.<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">笔记：O’Brien在拷问Winston，但我觉得，后续剧情中，Winston还会变得感激O’Brien</sub> It was he who asked the questions
    and suggested the answers. He was the tormentor, he
    was the protector, he was the inquisitor, he was the friend.
    And once—Winston could not remember whether it was
    in drugged sleep, or in normal sleep, or even in a moment
    of wakefulness—a voice murmured in his ear: ‘Don’t worry, Winston;
    you are in my keeping. For seven years I have
    watched over you. Now the turning-point has come. I shall
    save you, I shall make you perfect.’ He was not sure whether
    it was O’Brien’s voice; but it was the same voice that had
    said to him, ‘We shall meet in the place where there is no
    darkness,’ in that other dream, seven years ago.
    <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：讲述Winston被O’Brien拷问</sub>
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    He did not remember any ending to his interrogation.
    There was a period of blackness and then the cell, or room,
    in which he now was had gradually materialized round him.
    He was almost flat on his back, and unable to move. His
    body was held down at every essential point. Even the back
    of his head was gripped in some manner. O’Brien was looking
    down at him gravely and rather sadly. His face, seen
    from below, looked coarse and worn, with pouches under
    the eyes and tired lines from nose to chin. He was older
    than Winston had thought him; he was perhaps forty-eight
    or fifty. Under his hand there was a dial with a lever on top
    and figures running round the face.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘I told you,’ said O’Brien, ‘that if we met again it would be here.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Yes,’ said Winston.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Without any warning except a slight movement of
    O’Brien’s hand, a wave of pain flooded his body. It was a
    frightening pain, because he could not see what was happening,
    and he had the feeling that some mortal injury was
    being done to him. He did not know whether the thing was
    really happening, or whether the effect was electrically
    produced; but his body was being wrenched out of shape, the
    joints were being slowly torn apart. Although the pain had
    brought the sweat out on his forehead, the worst of all was
    the fear that his backbone was about to snap. He set his
    teeth and breathed hard through his nose, trying to keep
    silent as long as possible.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘You are afraid,’ said O’Brien, watching his face, ‘that in
    another moment something is going to break. Your especial
    fear is that it will be your backbone. You have a vivid mental
    picture of the vertebrae snapping apart and the spinal fluid
    dripping out of them. That is what you are thinking, is it
    not, Winston?’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Winston did not answer. O’Brien drew back the lever on
    the dial. The wave of pain receded almost as quickly as it
    had come.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘That was forty,’ said O’Brien. ‘You can see that the numbers
    on this dial run up to a hundred. Will you please
    remember, throughout our conversation, that I have it in
    my power to inflict pain on you at any moment and to whatever
    degree I choose? If you tell me any lies, or attempt to
    prevaricate<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">支吾搪塞；闪烁其词；吞吞吐吐 to avoid giving a direct answer to a question in order to hide the truth</sub> in any way, or even fall below your usual level
    of intelligence, you will cry out with pain, instantly. Do you
    understand that?’
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Yes,’ said Winston.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    O’Brien’s manner became less severe. He resettled his
    spectacles thoughtfully, and took a pace or two up and
    down. When he spoke his voice was gentle and patient. He
    had the air of a doctor, a teacher, even a priest, anxious to
    explain and persuade rather than to punish.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘I am taking trouble with you, Winston,’ he said, ‘because
    you are worth trouble. You know perfectly well what is the
    matter with you. You have known it for years, though you
    have fought against the knowledge. You are mentally deranged.
    You suffer from a defective memory. You are unable
    to remember real events and you persuade yourself that you
    remember other events which never happened. Fortunately
    it is curable. You have never cured yourself of it, because
    you did not choose to. There was a small effort of the will
    that you were not ready to make. Even now, I am well aware,
    you are clinging to your disease under the impression that
    it is a virtue. Now we will take an example. At this moment,
    which power is Oceania at war with?’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘When I was arrested, Oceania was at war with Eastasia.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘With Eastasia. Good. And Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia, has it not?’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Winston drew in his breath. He opened his mouth to
    speak and then did not speak. He could not take his eyes
    away from the dial.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘The truth, please, Winston. YOUR truth. Tell me what you think you remember.’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘I remember that until only a week before I was arrested,
    we were not at war with Eastasia at all. We were in alliance
    with them. The war was against Eurasia. That had lasted for
    four years. Before that——’
</p>

<p class="indented">
    O’Brien stopped him with a movement of the hand.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    ‘Another example,’ he said. ‘Some years ago you had a
    very serious delusion indeed. You believed that three men,
    three one-time Party members named Jones, Aaronson,
    and Rutherford—men who were executed for treachery
    and sabotage after making the fullest possible confession—
    were not guilty of the crimes they were charged with. You
    believed that you had seen unmistakable documentary evi-
    dence proving that their confessions were false. There was
    a certain photograph about which you had a hallucination.
    You believed that you had actually held it in your hands. It
    was a photograph something like this.’
