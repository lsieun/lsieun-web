    And the Records Department, after all, was itself only a
    single branch of the Ministry of Truth, whose primary job
    was not to reconstruct the past but to supply the citizens
    of Oceania with newspapers, films, textbooks, telescreen
    programmes, plays, novels—with every conceivable kind of
    information, instruction, or entertainment, from a statue to
    a slogan, from a lyric poem<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">抒情短诗</sub> to a biological treatise<sub
        class="my_note" style="color:green">专题论文</sub>, and from
    a child's spelling-book to a Newspeak dictionary. And the
    Ministry had not only to supply the multifarious<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">各种各样的</sub> needs of
    the party, but also to repeat the whole operation at a lower
    level for the benefit of the proletariat<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">无产阶级</sub>. There was a whole
    chain of separate departments dealing with proletarian<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">无产阶级的connected with
    ordinary people who earn money by working, especially those who do not own any property</sub> literature, music,
    drama, and entertainment generally. Here
    were produced rubbishy<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">质量低劣的of very poor quality</sub> newspapers containing
    almost
    nothing except sport, crime and astrology<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">占星术 the study of the positions of

    was called in Newspeak—engaged in producing the lowest
    kind of pornography, which was sent out in sealed packets
    and which no Party member, other than those who worked
    on it, was permitted to look at.

    Three messages had slid out of the pneumatic<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">由压缩空气操作的；风动的worked by air under

    Winston was working, but they were simple matters, and
    he had disposed of them before the Two Minutes Hate interrupted him. When the Hate was over he returned to
    his cubicle<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（大房间分隔出的）小房间，隔间a small room that is made by separating off part

    Winston's greatest pleasure in life was in his work. Most
    of it was a tedious routine, but included in it there were also
    jobs so difficult and intricate that you could lose yourself in
    them as in the depths of a mathematical problem—delicate<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">精致的；精细的；精密的made or

    pieces of forgery<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">伪造品；赝品something, for example a document, piece of paper

    except your knowledge of the principles of Ingsoc and your
    estimate of what the Party wanted you to say. Winston was
    good at this kind of thing. On occasion<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">间或；偶尔from time to time</sub> he had
    even been
    entrusted with the rectification of ‘The Times' leading articles, which were written entirely in Newspeak. He
    unrolled
    the message that he had set aside earlier. It ran:

    Winston read through the offending article. Big Brother's Order for the Day, it seemed, had been chiefly devoted
    to praising the work of an organization known as FFCC,
    which supplied cigarettes and other comforts to the sailors
    in the Floating Fortresses<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">浮岛要塞</sub>. A certain Comrade Withers, a
    prominent member of the Inner Party, had been singled out
    for special mention and awarded a decoration, the Order of
    Conspicuous<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">明显的；惹人注意的easy to see or notice; likely to attract attention</sub> Merit, Second Class.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Three months later FFCC had suddenly been dissolved
    with no reasons given. One could assume that Withers and
    his associates were now in disgrace<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">耻辱；不光彩the loss of other people's respect and approval because of the bad way sb has behaved</sub>, but there had been no
    report of the matter in the Press or on the telescreen. That
    was to be expected, since it was unusual for political offenders to be put on trial or even publicly denounced. The great
    purges involving thousands of people, with public trials of
    traitors and thought-criminals who made abject<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">下贱的；卑躬屈节的；自卑的without any pride or respect for yourself</sub> confession
    of their crimes and were afterwards executed, were special
    show-pieces not occurring oftener than once in a couple of
    years. More commonly, people who had incurred the displeasure of the Party simply disappeared and were never
    heard of again. One never had the smallest clue as to what
    had happened to them. In some cases they might not even
    be dead. Perhaps thirty people personally known to Winston, not counting his parents, had disappeared at one time
    or another.

    Winston stroked his nose gently with a paper-clip<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">回形针；曲别针；纸夹a piece of bent wire or plastic that is designed to hold loose sheets of paper together</sub>. In the
    cubicle across the way Comrade Tillotson was still crouching secretively over his speakwrite. He raised his head for
    a moment: again the hostile spectacle-flash. Winston wondered whether Comrade Tillotson was engaged on the same
    job as himself. It was perfectly possible. So tricky a piece of
    work would never be entrusted to a single person: on the
    other hand, to turn it over to a committee would be to admit openly that an act of fabrication was taking place. Very
    likely as many as a dozen people were now working away
    on rival versions of what Big Brother had actually said. And
    presently some master brain in the Inner Party would select this version or that, would re-edit it and set in motion
    the complex processes of cross-referencing that would be
    required, and then the chosen lie would pass into the permanent records and become truth.

<p class="indented">
    Winston did not know why Withers had been disgraced.
    Perhaps it was for corruption or incompetence. Perhaps Big
    Brother was merely getting rid of a too-popular subordinate. Perhaps Withers or someone close to him had been
    suspected of heretical tendencies. Or perhaps—what was
    likeliest of all—the thing had simply happened because
    purges and vaporizations were a necessary part of the mechanics of government. The only real clue lay in the words
    ‘refs unpersons', which indicated that Withers was already
    dead. You could not invariably assume this to be the case
    when people were arrested. Sometimes they were released
    and allowed to remain at liberty for as much as a year or
    two years before being executed. Very occasionally some
    person whom you had believed dead long since would make
    a ghostly reappearance at some public trial where he would
    implicate<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">牵涉，涉及（某人）to show or suggest that sb is involved in sth bad or criminal</sub> hundreds of others by his testimony<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">证词；证言；口供a formal written or spoken statement saying what you know to be true, usually in court</sub> before vanishing, this time for ever. Withers, however, was already an
    UNPERSON. He did not exist: he had never existed. Winston decided that it would not be enough simply to reverse
    the tendency of Big Brother's speech. It was better to make
    it deal with something totally unconnected with its original subject.

    He might turn the speech into the usual denunciation<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">公开谴责；斥责；指责an act of criticizing sb/sth strongly in public</sub> of
    traitors and thought-criminals, but that was a little too obvious, while to invent a victory at the front, or some triumph
    of over-production in the Ninth Three-Year Plan, might
    complicate the records too much. What was needed was a
    piece of pure fantasy. Suddenly there sprang into his mind,
    ready made as it were, the image of a certain Comrade Ogilvy, who had recently died in battle, in heroic circumstances.
    There were occasions when Big Brother devoted his Order
    for the Day to commemorating some humble, rank-and-file<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">普通士兵the ordinary soldiers who are not officers</sub>
    Party member whose life and death he held up as an example worthy to be followed. Today he should commemorate
    Comrade Ogilvy. It was true that there was no such person
    as Comrade Ogilvy, but a few lines of print and a couple of
    faked photographs would soon bring him into existence.

<p class="indented">
    Winston thought for a moment, then pulled the speakwrite towards him and began dictating in Big Brother's
    familiar style: a style at once military and pedantic<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">迂腐的；学究气的too worried about small details or rules</sub>, and,
    because of a trick of asking questions and then promptly
    answering them ('What lessons do we learn from this fact,
    comrades? The lesson—which is also one of the fundamental principles of Ingsoc—that,' etc., etc.), easy to imitate.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>

<p class="indented">
    At the age of three Comrade Ogilvy had refused all toys
    except a drum, a sub-machine gun, and a model helicopter.
    At six—a year early, by a special relaxation of the rules—he
    had joined the Spies, at nine he had been a troop leader. At
    eleven he had denounced his uncle to the Thought Police
    after overhearing a conversation which appeared to him to
    have criminal tendencies. At seventeen he had been a district organizer of the Junior Anti-Sex League. At nineteen
    he had designed a hand-grenade<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">手榴弹a small bomb that can be thrown by hand or fired from a gun</sub> which had been adopted
    by the Ministry of Peace and which, at its first trial, had
    killed thirty-one Eurasian prisoners in one burst. At twenty-three he had perished in action. Pursued by enemy jet
    planes while flying over the Indian Ocean with important
    despatches, he had weighted his body with his machine gun
    and leapt out of the helicopter into deep water, despatches
    and all—an end, said Big Brother, which it was impossible
    to contemplate without feelings of envy. Big Brother added a
    few remarks on the purity and single-mindedness<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">一心一意</sub> of Comrade Ogilvy's life. He was a total abstainer and a nonsmoker,
    had no recreations except a daily hour in the gymnasium,
    and had taken a vow of celibacy<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">禁欲；独身(生活)</sub>, believing marriage and the
    care of a family to be incompatible with a twenty-four-hour-
    a-day devotion to duty. He had no subjects of conversation
    except the principles of Ingsoc, and no aim in life except
    the defeat of the Eurasian enemy and the hunting-down of
    spies, saboteurs, thoughtcriminals, and traitors generally.

<p class="indented">
    Winston debated with himself whether to award Comrade Ogilvy the Order of Conspicuous Merit: in the end he
    decided against it because of the unnecessary cross-referencing that it would entail.

    Once again he glanced at his rival in the opposite cubicle.
    Something seemed to tell him with certainty that Tillotson
    was busy on the same job as himself. There was no way of
    knowing whose job would finally be adopted, but he felt a
    profound conviction<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">深信；坚信；坚定；肯定the feeling of believing sth strongly and of being sure about it</sub> that it would be his own. Comrade
    Ogilvy, unimagined an hour ago, was now a fact. It struck
    him as curious that you could create dead men but not living ones. Comrade Ogilvy, who had never existed in the
    present, now existed in the past, and when once the act of
    forgery was forgotten, he would exist just as authentically, and upon the same evidence, as Charlemagne<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">查理曼(742-814,于768-814为法兰克王,并于800-814为西罗马帝国之皇帝)</sub> or Julius Caesar.
