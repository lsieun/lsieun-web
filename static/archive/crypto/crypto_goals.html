<p class="indented">
    The primary goal of cryptography is to secure important data as it passes through a medium that
    may not be secure itself. Usually, that medium is a computer network.
</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p class="indented">
    There are many different cryptographic algorithms, each of which can provide one or more of the
    following services to applications:
</p>

<h3>Confidentiality (secrecy)</h3>

<p class="indented">
    Data is kept secret from those without the proper credentials, even if that data travels
    through an insecure medium. In practice, this means potential attackers might be able to
    see garbled<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">混乱不清的 confusing, or not accurate</sub> data that is essentially "locked," but they should not be able to unlock that
    data without the proper information. In classic cryptography, the encryption (scrambling)
    algorithm was the secret.<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">笔记：在过去的时代里，加密算法本身就是“秘密”</sub> In modern cryptography, that isn't feasible. The algorithms are
    public, and cryptographic keys are used in the encryption and decryption processes. The
    only thing that needs to be secret is the key.<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">笔记：在当今的时代里，加密算法本身是“公开”的，而key是“秘密”的。</sub> In addition,
    there are common cases in which not all keys need to be kept secret.

<h3>Integrity (anti-tampering)</h3>

<p class="indented">
    The basic idea behind data integrity is that there should be a way for the recipient of a
    piece of data to determine whether any modifications are made over a period of time. For
    example, integrity checks can be used to make sure that data sent over a wire isn't
    modified in transit. Plenty of well-known checksums exist that can detect and even
    correct simple errors. However, such checksums are poor at detecting skilled intentional
    modifications of the data. Several cryptographic checksums do not have these drawbacks
    if used properly. Note that encryption does not ensure data integrity.<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">笔记：注意，加密算法并不能保证只能保证数据的Confidentiality，而并不能保证数据的Integrity</sub> Entire classes of
    encryption algorithms are subject to "bit-flipping" attacks. That is, an attacker can change
    the actual value of a bit of data by changing the corresponding encrypted bit of data.

<h3>Authentication</h3>

<p class="indented">
    Cryptography can help establish identity for authentication purposes.
</p>

<h3>Non-repudiation</h3>

<p class="indented">
    Cryptography can enable Bob to prove that a message he received from Alice actually
    came from Alice. Alice can essentially be held accountable when she sends Bob such a
    message, as she cannot deny (repudiate) that she sent it. In the real world, you have to
    assume that an attacker does not compromise particular cryptographic keys.
</p>

<h2>Attacks</h2>

<p class="indented">
    These simple services can be used to stop a wide variety of network attacks, including:
</p>

<h3>Snooping (passive eavesdropping)</h3>

<div class="w3-panel w3-pale-blue w3-leftbar w3-border-blue">
    <p>
        snoop: 窥探；打探；探听 to find out private things about sb, especially by looking secretly around a place
    </p>
</div>

<p class="indented">
    An attacker watches network traffic as it passes and records interesting data, such as
    credit card information.
</p>

<h3>Tampering</h3>

<p class="indented">
    An attacker monitors network traffic and maliciously changes data in transit (for example,
    an attacker may modify the contents of an email message).
</p>

<h3>Spoofing</h3>

<div class="w3-panel w3-pale-blue w3-leftbar w3-border-blue">
    <p>
        spoof: （冒用他人电邮地址）发送仿真电邮；电邮欺骗 to send an email that appears to come from sb else's email address
    </p>
</div>

<p class="indented">
    An attacker forges network data, appearing to come from a different network address than
    he actually comes from. This sort of attack can be used to thwart systems that authenticate
    based on host information (e.g., an IP address).
</p>

<h3>Hijacking</h3>

<p class="indented">
    Once a legitimate user authenticates, a spoofing attack can be used to "hijack" the
    connection.
</p>

<h3>Capture-replay</h3>

<p class="indented">
    In some circumstances, an attacker can record and replay network transactions to ill effect.
    For example, say that you sell a single share of stock while the price is high. If the
    network protocol is not properly designed and secured, an attacker could record that
    transaction, then replay it later when the stock price has dropped, and do so repeatedly
    until all your stock is gone.
