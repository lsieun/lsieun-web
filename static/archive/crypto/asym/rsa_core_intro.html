    By far the most common public-key algorithm
    is the <strong>RSA</strong> algorithm, named after its inventors <strong>Ron Rivest</strong>, <strong>Adi Shamir</strong>, and
    <strong>Leonard Adleman</strong>.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    The theory behind RSA public-key cryptosystems is actually very simple. The
    core is <strong>modulus arithmetic</strong>. Specifically, RSA relies on three numbers
    <code>e</code>, <code>d</code>, and <code>n</code> such that <code>(m<sup>e</sup>)<sup>d</sup> % n = m</code> — here <code>m</code> is the message to be encrypted and
    converted to a number.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Not all numbers work this way; in fact, finding three numbers <code>e</code>, <code>d</code>, and <code>n</code> that
    satisfy this property is complex, and forms the core of the RSA specification. After
    you’ve found them, though, using them to encrypt is fairly straightforward. The
    number <code>d</code> is called the <strong>private key</strong>, and you should never share it with anybody.
    <code>e</code> and <code>n</code> together make up the <strong>public key</strong>, and you can make them available to
    anybody who cares to send you an encoded message. When the sender is ready
    to send you something that should remain private, he first converts the message
    into a number <code>m</code> and then computes m<sup>e</sup> % n and sends you the result <code>c</code>. When
    you receive it, you then compute c<sup>d</sup> % n and, by the property stated above, you
    get back the original message <code>m</code>.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    The security of the system relies on the fact that even if an attacker has access to
    <code>e</code> and <code>n</code> — which he does because they’re public — it’s computationally infeasible
    for him to compute <code>d</code>. For this to be true, <code>d</code> and <code>n</code> have to be enormous — at least
    512 bit numbers (which is on the order of 10<sup>154</sup>) — but most public key cryptosystems
    use even larger numbers. 1,024- or even 2,048-bit numbers are common.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    RSA works on blocks of data. Each block includes <strong>a header</strong> and <strong>some padding</strong> (of at least 11 bytes), so
    the resulting input blocks are <strong>modulus_length - 11</strong> bytes minimum. The header is
    pretty simple: It’s a <code>0</code> byte, followed by a padding identifier of <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, or <code>2</code>.
</p>

<div class="w3-panel w3-pale-blue w3-leftbar w3-border-blue">
    <p>
        block of data = header + padding + data
    </p>
</div>

<p class="indented">
    For <strong>RSA encryption</strong>, always
    use padding identifier <code>2</code>, which indicates that the following bytes, up to the first
    <code>0</code> byte, are <strong>padding</strong> and should be discarded. Everything following the first <code>0</code> byte,
    up to the length of the modulus <code>n</code> byte in bytes, is data.

    <p>
        Unlike the symmetric algorithms, RSA pads at the beginning of its block.
    </p>
</div>

<p class="indented">
    The only difference between an <strong>RSA digital signature</strong> and an <strong>RSA encryption</strong>
    (other than the fact that encryption is done with a public key and signing is done
    with a private key) is that the padding type is <code>0x01</code>, instead of
    <code>0x02</code>, and the padding bytes are all <code>1</code>s instead of random bytes.
