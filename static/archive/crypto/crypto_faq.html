<h3>Does Key Size Matter?</h3>

<p class="indented">
    Often, people associate the size of the key to the amount of security being applied.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    While cryptography does make e-commerce possible by protecting electronic information from
    prying eyes, the effectiveness of this protection partly depends on the cryptographic size of the
    key. If the algorithm is inherently strong, then it can be assumed that the larger the key size for
    the ciphers, the harder it is for a hacker to perform an attack (i.e., a brute-force attack) on the ciphertext.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    But applying the right level of security through key size is also somewhat dependent on the value
    of the data being transferred. The higher the value, the less risks the user is willing to take, the
    higher the level of security they will want to apply. Often, this means larger keys but <strong>larger keys
    leads to lower levels of performance.</strong> Simply put, it takes longer to communicate and in an ecommerce situation,
    larger keys can severely degrade server performance. There are, therefore,
    trade-offs, which are traditionally made between the level of security and other factors, like performance.
    These are issues, which must be addressed in the successful implementation of a
    cryptosystem or even a good security policy.
