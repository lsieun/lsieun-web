<p>
    When computers are used for cryptography, messages and keys are actually
    numbers. The message is converted to (or at least treated as) a number, which is
    numerically combined with the key (also a number) in a specified way according
    to a cryptographic algorithm. As such, an attacker without the key can try
    all keys, starting at “1” and incrementing over and over again, until the correct
    key is found. To determine when he’s hit the right combination, the attacker
    has to know something about the message that was encrypted in the first place,
    obviously. However, this is usually the case. Consider the case of an HTTP
    exchange. The first four characters of the first request are likely to be “GET.”
    The hypothetical attacker can just do a decryption using a proposed key, check
    the first four letters, and if they don’t match, move on to the next.

    This sort of attack is called a <strong>brute<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">蛮干不动脑筋的 involving physical strength only and not thought or intelligence</sub> force</strong> attack. To be useful and resistant to
    brute-force attacks, keys should be fairly large numbers, and algorithms should
    accept a huge range of potential keys so that an attacker has to try for a very, very
    long time before hitting on the right combination. <strong>There’s no defense against a
    brute-force attack; the best you can hope for is to ensure that an attacker spends
    so much time performing one that the data loses its value before a brute force
    attack might be successful.</strong>
