<h2>Key Schedule</h2>

<p class="indented">
    If you look at the diagram, you see that the subkeys are shown as K1, K2, K3, ... K15, K16. As it turns out, there are
    16 different 48-bit keys, which are generated deterministically from the initial 64-bit key input.
</p>

<h3>PC-1: key from 64-bit to 56-bit</h3>

<p class="indented">
    The 64-bit initial key undergoes an permutation: the first byte of the output is equal to the first bits of each input byte (backward); the second
    byte is equal to the second bit of each input byte; and so on.
    However, the 56-bit key itself is specified as two 28-bit halves — the second half works backward
    through the input bytes so that the first byte of the second half is the seventh
    bit of each input byte; the second byte is the sixth bit; and so on. Also, because
    the key halves are 28 bits each, there are only three and a half bytes; the last
    half byte follows the pattern but stops after four bits.

    If you look carefully at this table, you see that bits 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, and
    64 — the LSBs of each input byte — never appear. Early DES implementations
    used more fault-prone hardware than you are probably used to — the LSBs of
    the keys were used as <strong>parity bits</strong> to ensure that the key was transmitted correctly.
    Strictly speaking, you should ensure that the LSB of each byte is the sum
    (modulo 2) of the other seven bits. Most implementers don’t bother, as you can
    probably trust your hardware to hang on to the key you loaded into it correctly.

    Although the key input is 8 bytes (64 bits), the output of two 28-bit halves is only 56 bits.

<h3>56-bit key rotation</h3>

<h4>Encryption: rotate left</h4>

<p class="indented">
    At each round, each of the two 28-bit halves of this 56-bit key are rotated left
    once or twice — once in rounds 1, 2, 9, and 16, twice otherwise.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Perform the left rotation operation on the key. This is made fairly
    complex by the fact that the key is split into two 28-bit halves, each
    of which has to be rotated independently (so the second rotation operation
    starts in the middle of byte 3).
</p>

<h4>Decryption: rotate right</h4>

<p class="indented">
    One of the nice things about the way DES was specified is that decryption
    is the exact same as encryption, except that the <strong>key schedule</strong> is inverted.
    Instead of the original key being rotated left at each round, it’s rotated right.
    Otherwise, the routines are identical.
</p>

<h3>PC-2: key from 56-bit to 48-bit</h3>

<p class="indented">
    These rotated halves are then permuted (surprise) according to the second permutation table.
</p>

public static final int[] pc2_table = {

    44, 49, 39, 56, 34, 53,

</div>

<p class="indented">
    This produces a 48-bit subkey from the 56-bit (rotated) key. Due to the rotation,
    this means that each round has a unique key K1, K2, K3, ..., K15, K16. These
    subkeys are referred to as the <strong>key schedule</strong>.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Notice that the <strong>key schedule</strong> is independent of the encryption operations and
    can be precomputed and stored before encryption or decryption even begins.
    Most DES implementations do this as a performance optimization.
</p>

<h2>Encryption/Decryption Operation</h2>

<h3>DES Initial Permutation</h3>

<p class="indented">
    DES specifies that the input should undergo an initial permutation. The purpose
    of this permutation is unclear, as it serves no cryptographic purpose (the output
    would be just as secure without this). It may have been added for optimization
    for certain hardware types. Nevertheless, if you don’t include it, your output
    will be wrong, and you won’t be able to interoperate with other implementations.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    The specification describes this permutation in terms of the input bits
    and the output bits, but it works out to copying the second bit of the last byte
    into the first bit of the first byte of the output, followed by the second bit of the
    next-to-last byte into the second bit of the first byte of the output, and so on, so
    that the first byte of output consists of the second bits of all of the input bytes,
    “backward.” (Remember that the input is exactly eight-bytes long, so given an
    8-bit byte, taking the second bit of each input byte yields one byte of output.)

    <div class="w3-display-bottomright w3-container w3-text-black"><p>First byte of output</p></div>
</div>

<p>
    The second byte of the output is the fourth bit of each of the input bytes, again
    backward.

</div>

<p>
    The third is built from the sixth bits, the fourth from the eighth bits,
    and the fifth comes from the first bits, and so on.

<h3>DES Feistel Function</h3>

<h4>DES Expansion</h4>

<p class="indented">
    Notice in the previous section that the subkeys are 48-bits long, but the input
    halves that are to be XORed are 32 bits long. Now, you can’t properly XOR
    a 32-bit input with a 48-bit key, so the input is expanded — some bits are
    duplicated — before being XORed. The output of the expansion function is
    illustrated in the following figure.
</p>

<img class="w3-image" src="/images/crypto/des/des_expansion_function.png" alt="DES expansion function"/>

<div title="expansion_table" class="javacode">
/**
 * Expansion permutation
 */
public static final int[] expansion_table = {
    32,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,
     4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9,
     8,  9, 10, 11, 12, 13,
    12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,
    16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21,
    20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25,
    24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29,
    28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 1};
</div>

<h4>DES Substitution</h4>

<p class="indented">
    After this has been XORed with the correct subkey for this round, it is fed
    into the s-box lookup. The s-boxes are what makes DES secure. It’s important
    that the output not be a linear function of the input; if it was, a simple statistical
    analysis would reveal the key. An attacker knows, for example, that the letter
    “E” is the most common letter in the English language — if he knew that the
    plaintext was ASCII-encoded English, he could look for the most frequently
    occurring byte of output, assume that was an “E”, and work backward from
    there (actually, in ASCII-encoded English text, the space character 32 is more
    common than the “E”). If he was wrong, he could find the second-most occurring
    character, and try again. This sort of cryptanalysis has been perfected to
    the point where it can be performed by a computer in seconds. <strong>Therefore, the
    s-boxes are not permutations, rotations or XORs but are lookups into a set of
    completely random tables.</strong>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Each six-bits of the input — the expanded right-half XORed with the subkey — correspond
    to four bits of table output. In other words, each six bits of input
    is used as an index into a table of four-bit outputs. In this way, the expanded,
    XORed right half is reduced from 48-bits to 32. The s-boxes are described in a
    particularly confusing way by the DES specification. Instead, I present them
    here as simple lookup tables. Note that each six-bit block has its own unique s-box.
