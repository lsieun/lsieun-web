    As we know, DES operates on eight-byte input blocks. If the input is longer
    than eight bytes, the <code class="w3-codespan">des_block_operate</code> function must be called repeatedly. If the
    input isn't aligned on an eight-byte boundary, it has to be padded.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Of course, the padding must follow a specific scheme so that the decryption routine knows
    what to discard after decryption. If you adopt a convention of padding with 0
    bytes, the decryptor needs to have some way of determining whether the input
    actually ended with 0 bytes or whether these were padding bytes.

<h2>NIST 800-3A padding</h2>

<p class="indented">
    National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) publication 800-38A
    (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-38a/sp800-38a.pdf) recommends that
    a “1” bit be added to the input followed by enough zero-bits to make up eight
    bytes. Because you're working with byte arrays that must end on an 8-bit (one-byte) boundary,
    this means that, if the input block is less than eight bytes, you
    add the byte 0x80 (128), followed by zero bytes to pad. The decryption routine
    just starts at the end of the decrypted output, removing zero bytes until 0x80 is
    encountered, removes that, and returns the result to the caller.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Under this padding scheme, an input of, for example, “abcdef” (six characters)
    needs to have two bytes added to it. Therefore, “abcdef” would become
</p>

<div title="padding example" class="plaintext">
61 62 63 64 65 66 80 00
 a  b  c  d  e  f
</div>

<p class="indented">
    This would be encrypted under DES (using, say, a key of the ASCII string
    password) to the hex string: <code class="w3-codespan">25 ac 8f c5 c4 2f 89 5d</code>. The decryption routine would
    then decrypt it to <code class="w3-codespan">a, b, c, d, e, f, 0x80, 0x00</code>, search backward from the end for
    the first occurrence of <code class="w3-codespan">0x80</code>, and remove everything after it. If the input string
    happened to actually end with hex byte <code class="w3-codespan">0x80</code>, the decryptor would see <code class="w3-codespan">0x80
    0x80 0x0 ...</code> and still correctly remove only the padding.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    There's one wrinkle here; if the input <b>did</b> end on an eight-byte boundary that
    happened to contain 0 bytes following a <code class="w3-codespan">0x80</code>, the decryption routine would
    remove legitimate input. Therefore, if the input ends on an eight-byte boundary,
    you have to add a whole block of padding (<code class="w3-codespan">0x80 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0</code>) so
    that the decryptor doesn't accidentally remove something it wasn't supposed to.

<h2>PKCS #5 padding</h2>

<p class="indented">
    Another approach to padding, called <strong>PKCS #5 padding</strong>, is to append <strong>the
    number of padding bytes</strong> as <strong>the padding byte</strong>. This way, the decryptor can just
    look at the last byte of the output and then strip off that number of bytes from
    the result (with 8 being a legitimate number of bytes to strip off). Using the
    “abcdef” example again, the padded input now becomes
</p>

<div title="padding example" class="plaintext">
61 62 63 64 65 66 02 02
 a  b  c  d  e  f
</div>

<p class="indented">
    Because two bytes of padding are added, the number 2 is added twice. If the
    input was “abcde,” the padded result is instead.
</p>

<div title="padding example" class="plaintext">
61 62 63 64 65 03 03 03
 a  b  c  d  e
</div>

<p class="indented">
    If five bytes of padding are required, the very last byte of the decrypted
    output is 5.

<h2>PKCS7Padding</h2>

<h2>PKCS5Padding Vs PKCS7Padding</h2>

<p class="indented">
    The <strong>block size</strong> is a property of the used cipher algorithm. For AES it is always 16 bytes.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    So strictly speaking, PKCS5Padding cannot be used with AES since it is defined only for a block size of 8 bytes. I assume, <code class="w3-codespan">AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding</code> is interpreted as <code class="w3-codespan">AES/CBC/PKCS7Padding (128)</code> internally.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    The only difference between these padding schemes is that <strong>PKCS7Padding</strong> has the block size as a parameter, while for <strong>PKCS5Padding</strong> it is fixed at 8 bytes. When the Block size is 8 bytes they do exactly the same.
