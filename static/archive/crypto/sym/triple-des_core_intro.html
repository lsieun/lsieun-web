<h2>DES is obsolete</h2>

<p class="indented">
    DES is secure. After forty years of cryptanalysis, no feasible attack has been
    demonstrated; if anybody has cracked it, they’ve kept it a secret.
    <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：这里要明确区分三个概念，输入数据（input）、key和DES算法。这段的重点是说，DES算法本身是安全的，不安全的地方在key的长度比较短，只有56-bit数据。</sub>

</p>

<p class="indented">
    Unfortunately, the 56-bit key length is built into the algorithm. Increasing the key length requires
    redesigning the algorithm completely because the s-boxes and the permutations
    are specific to a 64-bit input. 56 bits is not very many, these days. 2<sup>56</sup> possible
    keys means that the most naive brute-force attack would need to try, on the
    average, 2<sup>55</sup> (2<sup>56</sup> / 2), or 36,028,797,018,963,968 (about 36,000 trillion operations)
    before it hit the right combination. This is not infeasible.
    <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：56-bit的key数据，在当代硬件运行速度的基础上，已经不够安全了。</sub>

<p class="indented">
    In fact, optimized, parallelized hardware has been shown to be capable of
    cracking a DES key by brute force in just a few days. The hardware is not cheap,
    but if the value of the data is greater than the cost of the specialized hardware,
    alternative encryption should be considered.

<h2>Triple DES</h2>

<p class="indented">
    The proposed solution to increase the keyspace beyond what can feasibly be
    brute-forced is called <strong>triple DES</strong> or <strong>3DES</strong>.
    <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：这里介绍了一种增加keyspace的方法就是使用Triple DES。</sub>
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    3DES has a 168-bit (56 * 3) key. It’s called triple-DES because it splits
    the 168-bit key into three 56-bit keys and repeats the DES
    rounds three times, once with each key.
    <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：3DES使用168-bit的key数据，需要调用DES算法3次。</sub>
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    The clearest and most
    secure way to generate the three keys that 3DES requires is to just generate 168
    bits,<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">笔记：第一种方式</sub> split them cleanly into three 56-bit chunks, and use each independently. The
    3DES specification actually allows the same 56-bit key to be used three times,<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">笔记：第二种方式</sub> or
    to use a 112-bit key,<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">笔记：第三种方式</sub> split it into two, and reuse one of the two keys for one of the
    three rounds. Presumably this is allowed for backward-compatibility reasons
    (for example, if you have an existing DES key that you would like to or need to
    reuse as is), but you can just assume the simplest case where you have 168 bits
    to play with.

</p>

<p class="indented">
    One important wrinkle<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">小问题 a small problem</sub> in the 3DES implementation is that you don’t encrypt
    three times with the three keys. Instead you <b>encrypt with one key</b>, <b>decrypt that
    with a different key</b> — remember that decrypting with a mismatched key produces garbage,
    but reversible garbage, which is exactly what you want when
    doing cryptographic work — and finally <b>encrypt that with yet a third key</b>.
    Decryption, of course, is the opposite — <b>decrypt with the third key</b>, <b>encrypt
    that with the second</b>, and finally <b>decrypt that with the first</b>. Notice that you
    reverse the order of the keys when decrypting; this is important!
    The Encrypt/Decrypt/Encrypt procedure makes cryptanalysis more difficult.

<div class="w3-panel w3-pale-blue w3-leftbar w3-border-blue">
    <p>Note that the “use the same key three times” option mentioned earlier is essentially useless.
        You encrypt with a key, decrypt with the same key, and re-encrypt again with
        the same key to produce the exact same results as encrypting one time.</p>
</div>

<p class="indented">
    Padding and cipher-block-chaining do not change at all. 3DES works with
    eight-byte blocks, and you need to take care with initialization vectors to ensure
    that the same eight-byte block encrypted twice with the same key appears different in the output.
