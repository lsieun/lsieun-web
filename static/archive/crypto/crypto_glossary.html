<ul>
    <li>Galois Field: Galois Field, named after Évariste Galois, also known as finite field, refers to a field in which there exists finitely many elements. It is particularly useful in translating computer data as they are represented in binary forms. In mathematics, a finite field or Galois field is a field that contains a finite number of elements. As with any field, a finite field is a set on which the operations of multiplication, addition, subtraction and division are defined and satisfy certain basic rules. </li>
