<h2>A</h2>

<ul>
    <li>AES: Advanced Encryption Standard</li>
    <li>Authentication: Assurance of identity of person or originator of data</li>
    <li>Authorization: Identity combined with an access policy grants the rights to perform some action</li>
</ul>

<h2>C</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Confidentiality: Protection from disclosure to unauthorized persons</li>
    <li>Cryptographic primitives: are well-established, low-level cryptographic algorithms that are frequently used to build cryptographic protocols for computer security systems. These routines include, but are not limited to, one-way hash functions and encryption functions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>D</h2>

<ul>
    <li>DES: Data Encryption Standard</li>
    <li>
        Digital Certificates: A "Certification Authority" signs a "special message" which contains the
        name of a user and the user's public key in such a way that "anyone" can verify that the "special
        message" was signed only by the "Certification Authority" and as a result trust the user's public
        key. This "special message" is termed as a certificate request and it is digitally signed using a
        "signature algorithm".
    </li>
    <li>
        Digital Envelopes: The "sender" seals the "message" such that only the "receiver" can open the
        sealed message. The message is encrypted with a secret key and the secret key is encrypted using
        the receiver's public key.
    </li>
    <li>
        Digital Signatures: The "signer" signs a "message" such that anyone can "verify" that the
        message was signed only by the "signer" and thus not modified by anyone else. This can be
        implemented using a message digest algorithm and a public key algorithm to encrypt the
        message digest.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>F</h2>

<ul>
    <li>FIPS: Federal Information Processing Standards 美国联邦信息处理标准</li>
</ul>

<h2>G</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Galois Field: Galois Field, named after Évariste Galois, also known as finite field, refers to a field in which there exists finitely many elements. It is particularly useful in translating computer data as they are represented in binary forms. In mathematics, a finite field or Galois field is a field that contains a finite number of elements. As with any field, a finite field is a set on which the operations of multiplication, addition, subtraction and division are defined and satisfy certain basic rules. </li>
</ul>

<h2>I</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Integrity: Maintaining data consistency</li>
</ul>

<h2>K</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        Key Agreement: Two "communicating parties" agree upon a secret key by exchanging
        messages without any prior agreements. Typically this consists of a two-phase key agreement
        algorithm. One party initiates the key agreement and this triggers the "first phase" of the key
        agreement after which both parties exchange the results of the first phase. After this, both parties
        initiate the "second phase" of the key agreement and as a result both parties arrive at the same
        secret key.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>N</h2>

<ul>
    <li>NIST: National Institute of Standards and Technology 美国国家标准与技术研究院 </li>
    <li>Non-repudiation: Originator of communications can't deny it later</li>
</ul>

<h2>P</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        Public Key Cryptography: This crypto-system uses one key for encryption and another key for decryption (also
        known as “asymmetric” cryptography); Each user has two keys – one public key, which is revealed to all users, and one private
        key, which remains a secret. The private key and the public key are mathematically linked; Encryption is performed with the public key and decryption is performed with the private
        key; Examples: RSA, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC).
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>S</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        Secret Key Cryptography: This crypto-system uses the same key for both encryption and decryption (this is also
        referred to as “symmetric” cryptography). Both the sender and the receiver need to have the same key in order to communicate
        successfully. Examples: DES, 3-DES, AES, RC4, RC5, etc.
    </li>
</ul>
