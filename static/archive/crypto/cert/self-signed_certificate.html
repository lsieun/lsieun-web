    A certificate can legally be signed by the private key corresponding
    to the public key contained within it. This sort of certificate is called a <strong>self-signed certificate</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    After all, my certificate is signed by a CA, but who signs
    their certificates? As a result, all top-level certificates are self-signed this way.
    How the client decides which self-signed top-level certificates to trust is not
    defined by the SSL specification. In the context of a web browser, for example,
    there’s always a list of trusted CAs that can be updated by the user.
