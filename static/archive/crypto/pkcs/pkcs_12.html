    Notice that the private key itself doesn’t appear anywhere in the certificate
    format, nor the CSR format. (This a good thing!) As you can imagine, when
    dealing with several certificates, it can become difficult to keep track of which
    private keys correspond to which public keys; some certificates expire, some
    need to be revoked due to a key compromise, some domains have their own
    certificates for security purposes, and so on. If you lose track of which private
    key goes with which certificate, you’re pretty much out of luck; it would be nice
    to store them together so you can always go back to the source.

    Storing the keys, of course, must be done in a secure way. The private key
    may be the most sensitive bit of information in the entire system. The PKCS
    #12 format was designed as a standardized way to transmit any arbitrary bit of
    data securely — by encrypting it in a standardized way — but in practice it is
    generally used to store <strong>certificates</strong> and <strong>their corresponding private keys</strong>. The
    PKCS #12 format was standardized from an older, de facto standard named PFX.
    As such, many applications that generate PKCS #12 files give them the extension <code>.pfx</code>.
    If you export a certificate and private key from Internet Explorer, for
    instance, you get a <code>.pfx</code> file.

    The PKCS #12 format is actually extremely general — a bit too general, in fact.
    The top-level structure consists of a version number, a sequence of bit strings,
    and a MAC over the whole thing. It’s up to the reader of the file to interpret the
    bit strings to figure out if they’re encrypted and what they contain.
