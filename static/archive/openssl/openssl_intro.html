<h2>Key Generation</h2>

<p class="indented">
    The first step in preparing for the use of <strong>public encryption</strong> is to generate a <strong>private key</strong>.

    Before you begin, you must make several decisions:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Key algorithm</b>: OpenSSL supports RSA, DSA, and ECDSA keys, but not all types are practical for use in all scenarios. For example, for web server keys everyone uses RSA, because DSA keys are effectively limited to 1,024 bits (Internet Explorer doesn’t support anything stronger) and ECDSA keys are yet to be widely supported by CAs. For SSH, DSA and RSA are widely used, whereas ECDSA might not be supported by all clients.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Key size</b>: The default key sizes might not be secure, which is why you should always explicitly configure key size. For example, the default for RSA keys is only 512 bits, which is simply insecure. If you used a 512-bit key on your server today, an intruder could take your certificate and use brute force to recover your private key, after which he or she could impersonate<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">冒充；扮演 to pretend to be sb in order to trick people or to entertain them</sub> your web site. Today, 2,048-bit RSA keys are considered secure, and that’s what you should use. Aim also to use 2,048 bits for DSA keys and at least 256 bits for ECDSA.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Passphrase</b>: Using a passphrase with a key is optional, but strongly recommended. Protected keys can be safely stored, transported, and backed up. On the other hand, such keys are inconvenient, because they can’t be used without their passphrases. For example, you might be asked to enter the passphrase every time you wish to restart your web server. For most, this is either too inconvenient or has unacceptable availability implications. In addition, using protected keys in production does not actually increase the security much, if at all. This is because, once activated, private keys are kept unprotected in program memory; an attacker who can get to the server can get the keys from there with just a little more effort. Thus, passphrases should be viewed only as a mechanism for protecting private keys when they are not installed on production systems. In other words, it’s all right to keep passphrases on production systems, next to the keys. If you need better security in production, you should invest in a hardware solution.
