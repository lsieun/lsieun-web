    微软，曾经受到了许多赞誉，后来又被认为是“万恶”之源。
</p>

<p>
    谷歌（Google），凭着开源越来越受欢迎。随着越来越受欢迎，它的市场也越来越大。它还会是一个无辜的IT公司吗？
</p>

<p>
    As of 2018 the biggest evil company on the planet is Google. Why? because Microsoft changed a lot in satya's leader ship more than Google in Sundar's .
</p>
<p>
    Microsoft is a way more receptive company today than Google. Microsoft is a normal company and way nicer than what they were in 90s.
</p>
<p>
    Yes, Microsoft is way more evil.

    While Google give away its genius MapReduce for Hadoop, Microsoft keep making money from Android through its bogus BS patents.

    Even though Microsoft tries to look good by open sourcing .NET (to leverage Azure and become monopoly again), its effort is futile. Microsoft is still evil.
</p>

<h2>Is Microsoft still considered the Evil Empire?</h2>

<p>
    I think yes and no.
    Yes because there is a saying “An image is easier to create than it is to change.”
    There will be all those that have an image of Microsoft burned into their mind, and it will not change very easily.
</p>
<p>
    Here lately, Microsoft has been open sourcing their latest software.
    Their new acquisition of Git-Hub is genuinely geared toward open source and having a place that allows everyone to contribute to that.
    Now when it comes to licensing their product, they are still “evil” but they are basically giving away the “knowledge” that in the past was quite expensive to obtain.
    Now you can get IT certified through Microsoft directly and the certs that you gain are accepted pretty much globally.
    They charge a small fee for each exam you take but the “classes” are 100% free to all.
</p>
<p>
    Microsoft like any corporation is in the business of making money for their shareholders.
    Corporations have a duty to do what ever it takes to pay back those that invest in them.
    Also, there are always going to be winners and losers when a corporation takes over another or institutes a policy that people do not like.
    Corporations will also try to eliminate competition.
    The more they can do this the better off their shareholders are.
    These are all good business practices.
    As long as they are ethical there should not be a problem.
</p>
<p>
    Since this is a free country, people are free to choose whose software they use or buy.
    The Evil Empire credo is when you analyze it just sour grapes.
</p>
<p>
    Probably not as much as the past when Steve Balmer and Bill Gates had control.
    The new CEO has done a lot to change the MS culture and how the company interacts with consumers and developers.
    They still have problems, but its not nearly as bad as it used to be.
</p>
<p>
    Apple, however, is slowly becoming what MS used to be.
    They dictate what consumers want, rather than listening to them, and they make life difficult for developers with proprietary features,
    minimal opens-source support, and the siloing of the Apple ecosystem, IMO.

<h2>Is Google becoming evil?</h2>

<p>
    Is Google becoming evil? Google has a 'don't be evil' motto, but with all the privacy issues and surfacing of brand content, are they really living by the motto anymore?
</p>
<p>
    It's a bit of a paradox, that a company which started out on the premise of giving people freedom to access information,
    has become a company which carries out massive surveillance, tailors the information it displays, and restricts it in many cases.
</p>
<p>
    Google is certainly dead to me, as well as to everybody who has a need for both privacy and unfettered access to information.
</p>
<p>
    No, I think some perspective is needed here. First of all, if we think about everything that happens in the world, with Boko Haram etc. the word 'evil' isn't really appropriate to describe what Google is doing.

    Google has never been 'good' and they've never been 'evil', they're a corporation, like any other, and their remit as such is to serve their shareholders, and that really is it. They have no other responsibilities other than to obey the law, or at least not break the law too egregiously.

    Google is an ad company, and as such, whether we like it or not, part of being an ad company is that *we* are the product, not any of their software items. Google provides us with services and software we use to further their ad business. The benefits of that to us, are significant, we get a load of stuff for free, or very cheap.

    The software Google make is a symptom, not the cause, ads are the cause.

    The downside is that we are shown a lot of ads and privacy is invaded in pretty minor ways. For example, if I go on AirBNB, I'm suddenly getting a lot of ads for AirBNB. Same for a used car site I frequent. It's all pretty harmless really. Sure, they scan your email for information, but with all the hundreds of millions of users they have, it's automatic, it's not like some seedy little bloke is reading our emails for cheap kicks. Frankly, we're numbers to them, our details are hidden in plain sight, and I can't think of any genuine way in which my real privacy has been invaded.

    That said, Google is doing a lot of damage in computing too, same as all the other companies giving stuff away and making money on ads, it's a popularity and numbers game, it's nothing to do with quality, and now quality has to compete with free stuff, which is not a good place to be.

    Also, with the free stuff, you don't need 10,000 users to make money, you need 10,000,000, at least. That's squeezing out niche and alternative players because there is no money in selling ads to 10,000 people, but back in the old days, there certainly was money in selling a $50 software product to 10,000 people.

    Evil? No. Good? No. Google isn't there to be either, they are there to make money.

    1) Google's biased search results and consumer misleading
    Google has an outstanding case for misleading consumers with biased search results.
