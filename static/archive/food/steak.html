<h2>1. Steak Doneness</h2>

<p>
    When it comes to nutrients there’s actually no difference between a steak that’s cooked rare or well done — the contrast is in the flavour<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">味道a particular type of taste</sub> and juiciness<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">多汁程度</sub>. For steaks, common graduations of doneness<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">煮熟的程度</sub> are based on the <b>colour, juiciness and internal temperature</b>. So, what’s the difference between <b>rare</b>, <b>medium</b>, and <b>well-done</b> steak?

<strong>Rare</strong>

<p>
    This refers to a steak that’s been cooked for a very short period of time — leaving the centre cool and red in colour. It’s just a stage up from raw meat — but cooked on the outside. Steak doesn’t contain parasites<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">寄生物；寄生虫 a small animal or plant that lives on or inside another animal or plant and gets its food from it</sub> that chicken and pork<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">猪肉meat from a pig that has not been cured</sub> do — eating it rare<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">半熟的；半生的 cooked for only a short time so that the inside is still red</sub> doesn’t pose any health risks.

</p>

<strong>Medium Rare</strong>

<p>
    Medium rare steaks are warm with a pink to red centre — soft and juicy on the inside and firm on the outside.
</p>

<strong>Medium</strong>

<p>
    More grey-brown than pink in the centre this steak has a more pronounced band of pink in the middle.
</p>

<strong>Medium Well</strong>

<p>
    Just a hint of pale pink inside this steak will be mostly grey-brown throughout — ideal if you want a slightly juicy steak without any blood.
</p>

<strong>Well-Done</strong>

<p>
    Well-done steaks are normally charred on the outside with and are greyish-brown all through with no sign of pink — they’re cooked on a slow heat to keep from toughening.
</p>

<h2>2. Types of Steak</h2>

<p>
    Now you know just how steak can be cooked to get the best flavour here’s an insight into the types of steak you can try:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Sirloin</b><sub class="my_note" style="color:green">牛里脊肉；牛上腰肉good quality beef that is cut from a cow's back</sub> — this lean<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">瘦肉 the part of meat that has little or no fat</sub> cut of meat can become tough if it’s cooked for too long — for a tender juicy steak its best served rare.<img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/></li>
    <li><b>Rib Eye</b><sub class="my_note" style="color:green">里脊肉；从肋骨外切下来的肉</sub> — about 6–8 minutes is all you need to cook an inch thick steak to produce a super flavour and juicy cut of prime rib.<img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/></li>
    <li><b>T-Bone</b><sub class="my_note" style="color:green">T骨牛排</sub> — this steak is cut from the loin<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（动物的）腰肉 a piece of meat from the back or sides of an animal, near the tail</sub> and tenderloin<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（牛、猪的）里脊肉，嫩腰肉good quality meat from the back or side of a cow or pig</sub> and can be cooked for a while longer if you prefer.<img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/></li>
    <li><b>Filet Mignon</b><sub class="my_note" style="color:green">菲力牛排；烤里脊肉片</sub> — also known as a fork-tender cut<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">用叉检查煮熟程度</sub> of beef cut from the heart of the tenderloin — this steak should be rare to be fully enjoyed.<img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/></li>
    <li><b>New York Strip Steak</b><sub class="my_note" style="color:green">纽约去骨牛排</sub> — flavoursome strips of steak from the heart of the beef loin take about 6–8 minutes to cook on average.<img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/></li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Healthy Cooking Advice</h2>

<p>
    It’s been proven that meat cooked until its <b>well-done</b><sub class="my_note" style="color:green">熟透的；煮透了的 cooked thoroughly or for a long time</sub> contains more potential carcinogens<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">致癌物 a substance that can cause cancer</sub> than meat cooked for a shorter time — laboratory tests have shown that this increase in heterocyclic amines<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">杂环状胺化合物</sub> can cause a higher risk of colon tumours<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">结肠肿瘤</sub> and colon polyps<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">结肠息肉</sub>. High intakes of well-done meat have also been linked to a greater risk of certain cancers.<sub class="my_note" style="color:red">笔记：全熟的牛排，含有更多的致癌物质</sub>
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    Research also suggests that heavy red meat eaters have an increased risk of developing type II diabetes<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">糖尿病a medical condition which makes the patient produce a lot of urine and feel very thirsty. There are several types of diabetes</sub>, coronary<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">冠状动脉的connected with the heart, particularly the arteries that take blood to the heart</sub> heart disease, and colorectal cancer<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">大肠直肠癌</sub> — so less than 18 ounces a week is recommended. It’s important to choose steaks that are lower in fat — such as sirloin<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">牛里脊肉；牛上腰肉 good quality beef that is cut from a cow's back</sub> or beef tenderloin<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（牛、猪的）里脊肉，嫩腰肉 good quality meat from the back or side of a cow or pig</sub> — and cook your steak to minimise the formation of heterocyclic acids.<sub class="my_note" style="color:red">笔记：相应的，不太熟的牛排也会导致一系列不同的疾病</sub>

</p>

<p>
    Keeping portions of steak small will cut down on cooking time — and pre-cooking in the microwave for just two minutes will significantly reduce the acids when cooking. Marinating<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">浸泡（食物）</sub> steaks before cooking with citrus juices<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">柑橘類果汁</sub>, spices<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（调味）香料one of the various types of powder or seed that come from plants and are used in cooking. Spices have a strong taste and smell</sub>, and vinegar<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">醋a liquid with a bitter taste made from malt (= a type of grain) or wine, used to add flavour to food or to preserve it</sub> may prevent carcinogen<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">致癌物 a substance that can cause cancer</sub> formation –and cooking at a lower temperature will also help.

<p>
    For an inch thick steak try this cooking option: season<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">加调料调味；加作料 to add salt, pepper, etc. to food in order to give it more flavour</sub> well with salt and pepper and sear<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">轻煎 to burn the surface of sth in a way that is sudden and powerful</sub> in a hot cast<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">铸件；铸造品an object that is made by pouring hot liquid metal, etc. into a mould(= a specially shaped container)</sub> iron pan. Put in the oven pre-heated to 160*C testing with a thermometer until centre of steak reaches 140*C. Take out of the oven and wrap in foil<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">箔纸（覆有箔的纸）paper that is covered in very thin sheets of metal</sub> — let it rest at room temperature for at least five minutes. This way the steak will lose only 5% of its moisture and be juicy and pink all the way through.

<h2>4. Wrap Up</h2>

<p>
    第一点，从<b>食材</b>的角度来说，在牛的不同部分的肉来作牛排的肉有优劣之分。
</p>

<p>
    第二点，从<b>烹饪</b>的角度来说，“全熟”和“不熟”都是不好的，都可能导致各种疾病。我个人认为，Medium Well是最好的选择，一个很简单的原因是“不带血丝”。
</p>

<p>
    第三点，从<b>食用</b>的角度来说，从牛排的“颜色”和“口感”两方面来评价。“颜色”，就是牛排的颜色是否看起来漂亮，鲜红色、粉色和浅褐色。“口感”，就是牛排是否多汁(肉质鲜嫩)，咬起来是否容易。
