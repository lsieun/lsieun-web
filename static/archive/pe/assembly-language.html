<h2 id="machine-language">Machine language</h2>

<p>
    Every type of CPU understands its own machine language.<br/>
    Instructions in machine language are numbers stored as bytes in memory.<br/>
    Each instruction has its own unique numeric code called its <b>operation code</b> or <b>opcode</b> for short.<br/>
    The 80x86 processor’s instructions vary in size.<br/>
    The <b>opcode</b> is always at the beginning of the <b>instruction</b>.<br/>
    Many instructions also include <b>data</b> (e.g., constants or addresses) used by the instruction.<br/>
</p>
<p>
    Machine language is very difficult to program in directly.<br/>
    Deciphering the meanings of the numerical-coded instructions is tedious for humans.<br/>
</p>

<h2 id="assembly-language">Assembly language</h2>

<p>
    An assembly language program is stored as text (just as a higher level language program).<br/>
    Each <b>assembly instruction</b> represents exactly one <b>machine instruction</b>.<br/>
</p>
<p>
    The general form of an assembly instruction is:

mnemonic operand(s)
</pre>

<p>
    An <b>assembler</b> is a program that reads a text file with assembly instructions<br/>
    and converts the assembly into machine code.<br/>
    Compilers are programs that do similar conversions for high-level programming languages.<br/>
    An assembler is much simpler than a compiler.<br/>
    Every assembly language statement directly represents a single machine instruction.<br/>
    High-level language statements are much more complex and may require many machine instructions.<br/>

<ul>
    <li>Netwide Assembler or NASM for short</li>
    <li>Microsoft’s Assembler (MASM)</li>
    <li>Borland’s Assembler (TASM)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    There are some differences in the assembly syntax for MASM/TASM and NASM.

<h2 id="instruction-operands">Instruction operands</h2>

<p>
    Machine code instructions have varying number and type of operands;<br/>
    however, in general, each instruction itself will have a fixed number of operands (0 to 3).<br/>
    Operands can have the following types:<br/>
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>register</b>: These operands refer directly to the contents of the CPU’s registers.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>memory</b>: These refer to data in memory.
        The address of the data may be a constant hardcoded into the instruction or
        may be computed using values of registers.
        Address are always offsets from the beginning of a segment.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>immediate</b>: These are fixed values that are listed in the instruction itself.
        They are stored in the instruction itself (in the code segment), not in the data segment.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>implied</b>: These operands are not explicitly shown.
        For example, the increment instruction adds one to a register or memory.
        The one is implied.
    </li>
</ul>
