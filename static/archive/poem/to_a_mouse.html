        "<b>To a Mouse, on Turning Her Up in Her Nest With the Plough, November, 1785</b>" is a Scots-language poem written by <b>Robert Burns</b> in 1785. According to legend, Burns was ploughing in the fields and accidentally destroyed a mouse's nest, which it needed to survive the winter. In fact, Burns's brother claimed that the poet composed the poem while still holding his plough.

    “最好的计划，不管人和鼠，往往都会落空。” 这是诗人罗伯特·彭斯（Robert Burns，1759—1796）诗歌《致老鼠》（1785年，26岁）中的一句。他写这首诗，是因为有一天在犁地的时候不小心弄翻了老鼠窝，自己非常愧疚，于是慨叹人生也像这老鼠窝一般，总会被不可控的偶然所操纵，造化弄人。

    在彭斯（Robert Burns）这首诗歌问世150多年以后，它感动了一位美国的工人作家，那就是《愤怒的葡萄》的作者约翰·斯坦贝克（John Steinbeck）。他受到「最好的计划，不管人和鼠，往往都会落空」这句话的影响，写出了中篇小说的典范之作《人鼠之间》。
    斯坦贝克希望通过小说来回应彭斯的这首诗。在他看来，大萧条时代的工人，生活在鼠与人之间，他们的生活也受着命运无常的捉弄。
