<p>Every President has a lot to do -- especially a modern-day United States President. He or she must:</p>

<ul>
    <li>oversee dealing with foreign countries and the defense of our land.<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">笔记：对外，守卫疆土</sub></li>
    <li>keep an eye on how our farms are doing.<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">笔记：农业，这里的重点是“粮食是维持生命的资源”。</sub></li>
    <li>try to make sure the industry and business of the country are humming along.<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">笔记：工业，这里的关注点是“国家整体的经济状况”。</sub></li>
    <li>make sure that there are jobs for workers in our nation.<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">笔记：就业，这里的关注点在于“单个人的经济状况”。</sub></li>
    <li>see that the laws of the country are carried out---and carried out fairly.<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">笔记：法律，这里的关注点是“维持社会秩序的公正”，保护好人的权利，让做坏事的人得到惩罚。</sub></li>
    <li>guard our national forest, parks and our resources for the use of all the people.<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">笔记：公共资源，这里的关注点是“让公民有一个良好的生活环境”</sub></li>
    <li>protect the public from harmful diseases and hazards.<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">笔记：天灾，这里的重点是“对于非人类的危险因素进行处理”，例如疾病、灾难。</sub></li>
</ul>

<p>
    The list could go on and on . . .
</p>

<p>
    <b>How can one person do all this? One "trick" a President has is to delegate jobs. He or she assigns or turns over much of the day-to-day work to others.</b> A good business leader, a principal of a school, or the editor of a newspaper does this, too. They pick qualified people to do certain work, expect them to do their best and then report back on what they have accomplished. The top person, such as the President, will probably make the final decisions. But he or she can't possibly do all the day-to-day work.

<p>
    <b>The President of the United States delegates much work to the Cabinet. Each Cabinet member is the head of an executive department of the government. The President meets with his/her Cabinet frequently to hear their reports and their suggestions.</b> Usually, they meet together once a week or every other week. They meet in the Cabinet Room next to the President's Oval Office<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">美国白宫的椭圆形总统办公室</sub> in the White House West Wing. This room faces the Rose Garden and is a beautiful room furnished with draperies<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">垂褶；帐帘</sub>, chandeliers<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">枝形吊灯</sub>, and leather chairs<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">皮革座椅</sub>.
