<h2>
    Differences in Philosophy
</h2>

<p>
    Republican philosophy leans more towards individual freedoms, rights and responsibilities.
</p>

<p>
    In contrast, Democrats attach greater importance to equality and social/community responsibility.
</p>

<h2>
    Role of Government
</h2>

<p>
    One of the fundamental differences between Democratic and Republican party ideals is around the role of government.
</p>

<p>
    Democrats tend to favor a more active role for government in society and believe that such involvement can improve the quality of people’s lives and help achieve the larger goals of opportunity and equality.
</p>

<p>
    On the other hand, Republicans tend to favor a small government — both in terms of the number of people employed by the government and in terms of the roles and responsibilities of government in society. They see "big government" as wasteful and an obstacle to getting things done. Their approach is Darwinian capitalism in that strong businesses should survive in a free market rather than the government influencing—through regulation—who wins or loses in business.
</p>

<h2>
    Military
</h2>

<p>
    Republicans: Prefer increasing military spending and have a more hard line stance against countries like Iran, with a higher tendency to deploy the military option.
</p>

<p>
    Democrats: Prefer lower increases in military spending and are comparatively more reluctant to using military force against countries like Iran, Syria and Libya.
</p>

<h2>
    Gun control laws
</h2>

<p>
    Democrats favor more gun control laws e.g. oppose the right to carry concealed weapons in public places.
</p>

<p>
    Republicans oppose gun control laws and are strong supporters of the Second Amendment (the right to bear arms) as well as the right to carry concealed weapons.
</p>

<h2>
    Abortion
</h2>

<p>
    Democrats support abortion rights and keeping elective abortions legal.
</p>

<p>
    Republicans believe abortions should not be legal and that Roe v. Wade<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">笔记：罗诉韦德案，在该案中美国最高法院判决堕胎不违反宪法）a legal case in the US Supreme Court that decided that abortion is allowed by the Constitution</sub> should be overturned.

<h2>
    LGBTQ rights
</h2>

<div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
    <p>
        LGBTQ是女同性恋者（Lesbians）、男同性恋者（Gays）、双性恋者（Bisexuals）、变性人（Transgender）与不正常性取向的人（Queer）的英文首字母缩略字。
    </p>
</div>

<p>
    Democrats tend to favor equal rights for gay<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">同性恋者（尤指男性）a person who is homosexual , especially a man</sub> and lesbian<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">女同性恋者a woman who is sexually attracted to other women</sub> couples e.g. the right to get married and adopt children.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    Republicans believe that marriage should be defined as between a man and a woman so they do not support gay marriage, nor allowing gay couples to adopt children.
</p>

<h2>
    Taxes
</h2>

<p>
    Democrats support progressive taxes. A progressive tax system is one where high-income individuals pay taxes at a higher rate. This is the how federal income tax brackets are currently set up. For example, the first $10,000 in income is taxed at 10% but marginal income over $420,000 is taxed at 39.6%.
</p>

<p>
    Republicans support regressive taxation (tax cuts for everyone, rich and poor alike). They believe that a smaller government would need less revenue from taxes to sustain itself. Some Republicans are proponents<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">倡导者；支持者；拥护者a person who supports an idea or course of action</sub> of a "flat tax" where all people pay the same percentage of their income in taxes regardless of income level. They consider higher tax rates on the rich a form of class warfare.

</p>

<h2>
    Immigration
</h2>

<p>
    Democrats see America as a nation of immigrants.﻿ They want to welcome asylum<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（政治）庇护，避难 protection that a government gives to people who have left their own country, usually because they were in danger for political reasons</sub> seekers and refugees. Obama created the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA. DACA protected from deportation<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">驱逐出境</sub> people who were brought to the United States as children.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    Republican immigration policies seek to protect American workers and industries. Trump's immigration policies follow economic nationalism. For example, he wants to complete the border wall with Mexico.﻿He has threatened to deport<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">把（违法者或无居留权的人）驱逐出境；递解出境 to force sb to leave a country, usually because they have broken the law or because they have no legal right to be there</sub> immigrants protected under DACA. He wants to reduce the number of refugees.
