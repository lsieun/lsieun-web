    The <strong>American Dream</strong> is a national ethos<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">（某团体或社会的）道德思想，道德观 the moral ideas and attitudes that belong to a particular group or society</sub> of the United States, the set of ideals (democracy, rights, liberty, opportunity and equality) in which freedom includes the opportunity for prosperity and success, as well as an upward social mobility for the family and children, achieved through hard work in a society with few barriers. In the definition of the American Dream by James Truslow Adams in 1931, <strong>"life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement" regardless of social class or circumstances of birth.</strong>

    The American Dream is rooted in the <a href="/archive/usa/Declaration_of_Independence.html">Declaration of Independence</a>, which proclaims<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">宣布；宣告 to publicly and officially tell people about sth important</sub> that "all men are created equal" with the right to "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." Also, the U.S. Constitution promotes similar freedom, in the Preamble: to "secure the Blessings<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">有益之事 something that is good or helpful</sub> of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">后代；后裔；子孙；后世 all the people who will live in the future</sub>".

    For many immigrants, the Statue of Liberty was their first view of the United States. It signified new opportunities in life and thus the statue is an iconic<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">符号的； acting as a sign or symbol of sth</sub> symbol of the American Dream.
