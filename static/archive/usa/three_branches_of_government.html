<h2>
    1. Three Branches
</h2>

<p>
    USA federal government has three parts. They are the <b>Executive</b> (President and about 5,000,000 workers), <b>Legislative</b> (Senate and House of Representatives) and <b>Judicial</b> (Supreme Court and lower Courts).
</p>

<h2>
    2. Executive Branch
</h2>

<p>
    The <b>President of the United States</b> administers the <b>Executive</b> Branch of the government. The President enforces the laws that the <b>Legislative</b> Branch (Congress) makes. The President is elected by United States citizens, 18 years of age and older, who vote in the presidential elections in their states.
</p>

<h2>
    3. Legislative Branch
</h2>

<p>
    The <b>Legislative</b> part of the government is called <b>Congress</b>. Congress makes the laws. Congress is divided into 2 parts. One part is called the <b>Senate</b><sub class="my_note" style="color:green">参议院</sub>. There are 100 Senators--2 from each of the states<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">笔记：美国一共50个州，每个州有2个名额，一共100个人。</sub>. Another part is called the <b>House of Representatives</b><sub class="my_note" style="color:green">众议院</sub>. Representatives meet together to discuss ideas and decide if these ideas (bills) should become laws. There are 435 Representatives. The number of representatives each state gets is determined by its population<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">笔记：在众议院当中，每个州的名额与该州的总人口数量成正比。</sub>. Some states have just 2 representatives. Others have as many as 40. Both senators and representatives are elected by the eligible voters in their states.
