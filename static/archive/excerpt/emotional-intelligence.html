<p>
    There is no true success without emotional success.<br/>
    Yet of the more than three thousand emotions that we have words to describe.<br/>
    The average person experience is only about a dozen different ones in the course of an average week.<br/>
    We must remember that this doesn't reflect our emotional capacity;<br/>
    but rather the limitations of our present patterns of focus.
</p>

<p>
    There are 3,000 words in the English thesaurus that describe various emotions.<br/>
    In that 1051 words describe positive emotions,<br/>
    while 2086 almost twice as many describe negative emotions.<br/>
    But what this means is that we've made so many words to describe an unpleasant emotion.<br/>
    <span class="text-key-point">And we tend to focus more on what is unpleasant about life than looking at the bright side.</span>
    <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：这里侧重讲负面情绪。</sub>

</p>

<p>
    <span class="text-key-point">Life is an emotional experience.</span><br/>
    The quality of emotion you experience every day ultimately determines the quality of your life.<br/>
    And above all, your happiness depends on it.
    <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：生活，就是情绪体验。这句话讲的太好了。</sub>

</p>

<p>
    One key problem with most people is that<br/>
    they're not able to understand what they feel or<br/>
    they find it hard to name their emotions.<br/>
    This is a place where you need to become emotionally intelligent and<br/>
    become emotionally aware of the feelings you're experiencing.
</p>

<p>
    Emotional intelligence is your ability to identify what you're feeling,<br/>
    why you're feeling it and how your feelings not only affect you but all those around you.<br/>
    So when we learn to become more emotionally intelligent, we begin to master self -
    really know thyself, and understand what it is that is keeping you stuck.
    What limits you, and what triggers you, what get you angry,<br/>
    what gets you sad, and hurt, what causes you to take things so personally.
</p>

<p>
    So when you are improving your emotional intelligence,<br/>
    what that will allow you to do is become less reactive and more interactive with conversations.<br/>
    When you're in control of your emotions, you're emotionally intelligent.<br/>
    When emotions are controlling you, you're acting irrational and emotionally enslaved.
</p>

<p>
    The only way to effectively use your emotions is to understand how they all serve you.<br/>
    You must learn from your emotions and use them to create the results you want.<br/>
</p>

<p>
    <span class="text-key-point">Emotions are action signals.</span><br/>
    Very often their meanings are hidden.<br/>
    And we seldom ignore these hidden messages.<br/>
    There's so much to learn from an emotion, even the unpleasant emotions.<br/>
    All emotions are a call for action.<br/>
    Once you're familiar with the hidden messages in emotion and it's action signal,<br/>
    your unpleasant emotions can become your ally.
    <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：emotion --&gt; hidden message --&gt; action signal</sub>
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    Learning to use these signals frees you from the fears and<br/>
    allows you to experience all the richness of which we humans are capable.<br/>
    There are hidden messages in every emotion.<br/>
    We're aware of the messages behind our pleasant emotions,<br/>
    but we're not well aware of the messages behind our unpleasant emotions.
</p>

<p>
    When we do not understand our emotions,<br/>
    they become unpleasant experiences to us.<br/>
    All negative emotions contain within them positive messages or instructions that<br/>
    can help us grow as better human beings.
    <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：negative emotions --&gt; positive messages</sub>
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    We experience emotions for several reasons.<br/>
    We experience them because emotions are the language of the subconscious mind.<br/>
    We can master our negative, unpleasant emotions<br/>
    when we learn how they serve us rather than enslave us.
</p>

<h2>Hurt</h2>

<p>
    Let's look at the emotion HURT for example.<br/>
    As we make our journey through life none of us escapes being hurt.<br/>
    These painful feelings arise when we experience loss.<br/>
    It could be a loss of trust or an expectation<br/>
    that is not being met by us or by others who are dear to us.<br/>
    You're likely to feel hurt<br/>
    when you're betrayed badly treated or ignored by people you care about.<br/>
    It hurts when they're insensitive to your needs.<br/>
    Therefore we feel disappointed and we communicate the feeling of hurt<br/>
    through various emotions like pain or anger.
    <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：loss --&gt; hurt</sub>
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    What is the hidden message in HURT.<br/>
    Benjamin Franklin said "those things that hurt instruct".<br/>
    The message in hurt is that your expectations have not been met.
    <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：hurt --&gt; hidden message --&gt; your expectations have not been met</sub>
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    Many times this feeling arises<br/>
    when we've expected somebody to keep their word and they didn't.<br/>
    In this case you feel a loss of intimacy with this person.<br/>
    Maybe a loss of trust.<br/>
    This sense of loss is what creates the feeling of hurt.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="text-key-point">The solution is to realize that, in reality you may not have lost anything.</span><br/>
    Maybe what you need to lose is the false perception<br/>
    that this person is trying to wound you or hurt you.<br/>
    Maybe they don't realize the impact of their actions on your life.<br/>
    In reality, most people are ignorant about the impact of their words and deeds in other people's lives.
    <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：第一个解决方法，别人没有达成你的期望，你没有获得某种东西，但重点是实际上你并不失去什么。</sub>
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    <span class="text-key-point">Secondly, communicate with the individuals who's hurting you and tell them how you feel.</span><br/>
    Communicate your expectations with other people.<br/>
    People will not know your expectations until you tell them.
    <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：第二个解决方法，就是进行沟通，把你的感受告诉别人。</sub>
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p>
    Certain things are valuable to you but they may not be valuable to other people.<br/>
    Our values are different.<br/>
    Communicate your values to others especially your dear ones.<br/>
    Let them know what's important to you and what your expectations of others are.
</p>

<h2>Anger</h2>

<p>
    We feel angry when we're hurt.
    What does anger teach us?<br/>
    How can anger serve us rather than aggravate more chaos?<br/>
    You feel angry when you take offense at being hurt or experiencing loss.
</p>

<p>
    Angry feelings arise when you feel helpless, threatened, deprived or unfairly treated.<br/>
    Anger is a physiological sensation due to the biochemical reaction in your body.<br/>
    Adrenaline is created in the body as a protective mechanism<br/>
    that prepares our body to fight against the attack.<br/>
    Bodily tension and other disturbing emotions often accompany anger.<br/>
    You can experience frustration, irritability, annoyance,
    resentment, hatred or even rage at various levels.
</p>

<p>
    You may be choosing to react with anger in a dominating manner rather than feel hurt.<br/>
    Because you perceive hurt as a sign of vulnerability.<br/>
    Anger keeps people at a distance.<br/>
    And this enables you to conceal your vulnerability.<br/>
    In fact anger is nothing but a shield that covers your underlying fears and hurts.<br/>
    Inside a short-tempered person there is unsettling hurt, frustration and a cry for help.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="text-key-point">The hidden message in anger is that an important rule or standard</span><br/>
    that you hold for your life <span class="text-key-point">has been violated by someone else, or maybe even by you.</span><br/>
    You feel angry with certain standards on that.<br/>
    When some of the rules you have about life are violated you feel angry and rage.
</p>

<p>
    Most anger isn't happening in the actual context of what's going on.<br/>
    It's an old story coming up, an old hurt, an old wound, an old concern.<br/>
    Am I respected enough?<br/>
    Am I cared for enough?<br/>
    How dare they?<br/>
    All these things are the Child Mind, they're the Ego Mind, I just call it the Drama Mind.<br/>
    The thing that wants to make something a bigger problem than it really is!.
</p>

<p>
    Because you have no perspective on life.<br/>
    About that as you've traveled or you've experienced more in life;<br/>
    you've realized a lot of people have a very difficulty in life.<br/>
    You've realized, there's a lot of poverty.<br/>
    Realize, there's a lot of struggles,<br/>
    you realize there's a lot of hurt and pain.<br/>
    And hopefully that gives you some perspective to say<br/>
    "Geez somebody cutting me off isn't such a big deal anymore".
</p>

<p>
    Because here's the reality,<br/>
    especially if you keep getting angry about the same thing over and over and over again:<br/>
    you are a victim of the "drama mind".<br/>
    And that victim is you. You have the ability to turn that off.<br/>
    And the way you do is WAIT.
</p>

<p>
    You enlarge the gap of time between stimulus and response.<br/>
    That's where all self mastery comes from -<br/>
    enlarging the time between stimulus and response.<br/>
    So now it's not the drama mind, it's not the impulsive mind,<br/>
    it's the intentional mind.
</p>

<p>
    Anger is no way of telling other people that you're right and others are wrong.<br/>
    Anger is not the display of superiority.<br/>
    Anger is the loud cry of an unsettling hurt.
</p>

<p>
    See anger is a secondary emotion.<br/>
    The primary emotion is frustration.<br/>
    Primary emotion is frustration.
</p>

<h2>Frustration</h2>

<p>
    Frustration is wanting something and not getting it.<br/>
    I want to have a certain thing happen.<br/>
    I want to get this thing.<br/>
    I want to experience a certain opportunity or a thing happen in my life.

</p>

<p>
    If you want to get past anger you have to stop it at frustration.<br/>
    It's okay to want what you want,<br/>
    but you got to quit that negative thinking-<br/>
    that negative self-talk pattern of "your bad, I'm going to punish you".
</p>

<p>
    See, the moment you start to make that demand "I've got to have my way" and<br/>
    then blaming them "you're the problem, you're what's wrong here".<br/>
    When you do that you automatically get sucked into the drama.
</p>

<p>
    You experience the emotion of frustration due to your rigid beliefs and thinking.<br/>
    When frustrations hit you and surely they will on many occasions,<br/>
    remember to become more flexible and adaptive to change your viewpoints on something<br/>
    that are currently producing negative results.
</p>

<p>
    The message in frustration and disappointment is that<br/>
    your brain believes you could be doing better than you currently are.<br/>
    Frustration is very different from disappointment<br/>
    which is the feeling that there's something you want in your life<br/>
    which you'll never get it.<br/>
    Constant frustration means that the solution to your problem is within range,<br/>
    but what you are currently doing isn't working.
</p>

<p>
    And you need to change your approach in order to achieve your goal.<br/>
    Take care of your frustrations in life.<br/>
    It's a way life is teaching you that your life is 'off the track' and 'off the course'.<br/>
    When you're not using your talents gifts and resources to the full extent, you become frustrated.
</p>

<p>
    When you don't get the results you want, you get frustrated.<br/>
    Sometimes you can experience this emotion without any trigger.<br/>
    When you focus too much on life's problems, you can get frustrated.<br/>
    Constant irritability, feeling of annoyance, discomfort,<br/>
    and a state of unhappiness stems up as a result of continuing frustrations.
</p>

<p>
    As frustration grows and when you begin to accept helplessness as a result,<br/>
    another major emotional state strikes you.<br/>
    That's called the Big D - Depression.
</p>

<h2>Depression</h2>

<p>
    When you suffer pain and loss and<br/>
    do not express and resolve your feelings of helplessness, hurt, anger, and grief<br/>
    you will eventually experience depression.
</p>

<p>
    When you're depressed, you tend to focus on your losses,<br/>
    your inner emptiness, unfulfilled dreams, and problems.<br/>
    You may experience a feeling of helplessness and worthlessness.<br/>
    According to Martin Seligman, the father of positive psychology in his book 'Learned Optimism'<br/>
    he writes: "a pessimistic explanatory style is it the core of all depressed thinking".
</p>

<p>
    A negative concept of the future, the self in the world stems from<br/>
    seeing the causes of bad events as permanent, pervasive, and personal and<br/>
    seeing the causes of good events in the opposite way.
</p>

<p>
    The state of depression is sending a strong message.<br/>
    The hidden message in depression is to find a purpose in life.<br/>
    The message is invoking the depressed to reevaluate what is absolutely important to them.<br/>
    If anyone is paying more attention to minor things in life<br/>
    ignoring the majors then that is the primary reason to make someone feel depressed in the first place.
</p>

<p>
    Depression sends the message to prioritize what is important to you.<br/>
    Instead of feeling burdened and helpless<br/>
    those who lose sight of their priorities in life<br/>
    will always feel burdened and they feel sick most of the time.
</p>

<p>
    People who are depressed are the most ungrateful people on earth.<br/>
    They don't focus on their blessings.<br/>
    They look at what's missing and<br/>
    they whine about what's lost and seldom think about what can be gained.
</p>

<h2>Grief</h2>

<p>
    We tend to experience depression when another emotion is not well handled by us.<br/>
    That emotion is grief.<br/>
    Grief occurs when we experience a major loss.<br/>
    Grief happens when you feel like there's no empowering meaning for<br/>
    something that has happened or that your life is being negatively impacted by people,
    events or forces that are outside your control.<br/>
    The excruciating pain of losing a loved one can be most severe suffering we ever endure.
</p>

<p>
    The answer to grief is acceptance.<br/>
    Accept the things that can't be changed and change the things that can't be accepted.<br/>
    When you feel that it's appropriate to start letting go of grief;<br/>
    start focusing on what you can control and realize that<br/>
    there must be some empowering meaning to it all<br/>
    even though you can't comprehend it yet.
</p>

<p>
    What stops us from expressing the emotion of grieving is the emotion of fear.
</p>

<h2>Fear</h2>

<p>
    Fear is nature's way of protecting you from real and current danger.<br/>
    It prepares you to escape from harm.<br/>
    Fearful emotions include everything from low levels of concern and apprehension,<br/>
    to intense worry, anxiety, fright and even terror.
</p>

<p>
    The message is: fear is simply the anticipation<br/>
    that's something that's going to happen soon needs to be prepared for.<br/>
    Fear is telling you to be prepared,<br/>
    to deal with something negative or uncomfortable from happening.
</p>

<p>
    It's telling you to prepare for your plan B or the worst case scenario.<br/>
    Don't permit fear to control your life.<br/>
    Absolutely refuse to it.<br/>
    Someone said "fear knock on the door, faith opened it and there was no one there".<br/>
    You see you eliminate fear through intelligent action.<br/>
    Face the thing you fear and fear will leave you.
</p>

<h3>Fears caused by the unknown</h3>

<p>
    Fears caused by the unknown.<br/>
    If there's something you're afraid of, go study it, understand it,<br/>
    talk to someone who's a professional in that particular area.<br/>
    But for goodness sake don't let it control your life anymore.
</p>

<p>
    Think of the people that are afraid to go into their own business.<br/>
    They're afraid to move to the place they'd really like to go.<br/>
    They're afraid to ask the girl or the guy for a date.<br/>
    What are they doing?!<br/>
    Their life is drying up and shrinking.<br/>
    We're only here for a short time.<br/>
    Make it a good time.<br/>
    Get rid of the fear. Face it.
</p>

<h2>Loneliness</h2>

<p>
    A state of emotion that can disconnect us from the rest of the world is the emotion of loneliness.<br/>
    We all suffer the misery of loneliness at some time in our lives.<br/>
    You feel lonely when you experience yourself as separate and disconnected from others.<br/>
    When the pain of isolation is overwhelming, you feel heartbroken.
</p>

<p>
    Loneliness is an authentic sign of unfulfilled social and intimacy needs.<br/>
    When you are emotionally unavailable to people, you detach yourself from people,<br/>
    and as a result you'll experience loneliness and boredom.
</p>

<p>
    You have the urge to connect with other people,<br/>
    but you have fears that stop you from connecting with other people.<br/>
    As a result, you withdraw into yourselves making yourself<br/>
    unreachable and unavailable to people who love you.
</p>

<p>
    Many irrational ideas and assumptions lead to the feelings of loneliness,<br/>
    including thoughts like 'no one likes me', 'there's no one available'<br/>
    and 'everyone is busy and selfish with their lives' and 'they have no time for me'.
</p>

<p>
    Loneliness can be temporary but emotional isolation and social phobia can become clinical cases.<br/>
    The message of loneliness is that it's time to connect with people.<br/>
    It means you really care about people and you love to be with them.
</p>

<p>
    You need to find out what kind of connection you need with somebody right now<br/>
    and then take action immediately to make that happen.<br/>
    It means you need to start enjoying the pleasure of companionship.
</p>

<p>
    Loneliness is telling you to overcome all your fears about trusting people.<br/>
    All negative emotions ask you to change your perceptions.<br/>
    They tell you to change the meaning you associate with things, events or people.
</p>

<p>
    Certain things if you continue to view them as painful,<br/>
    they'll be painful to you all through your life.<br/>
    If you can change the meaning attached to almost anything<br/>
    then you can change the experience itself.
</p>

<h2>Unworthiness</h2>

<p>
    One of the dangerous emotions that can take away your drive to live a fuller life<br/>
    is the emotion of self inadequacy or unworthiness.<br/>
    The feeling of unworthiness occurs anytime<br/>
    we feel we can't do something we should be able to do.
</p>

<p>
    This emotion of self inadequacy is sending you a strong message,
    pleading you to work on yourself.
    <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：这里所带来的信息就是“低价值感，意味着要提升自己的能力”。</sub>
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)" alt=""/>
</p>

<p>
    This is a personal development message that if you work on certain areas;<br/>
    you'll become better at it.<br/>
    And you can achieve your desired outcome.<br/>
    The message of unworthy feelings is that<br/>
    you don't presently have a level of skill or aptitude necessary for the task at hand.
</p>

<p>
    It's telling you that you need more information, understanding, knowledge, strategies, tools, and confidence.<br/>
    It's an invitation to build skills to tackle challenges that are overwhelming.
</p>

<p>
    One of the fastest ways to build self-confidence is to think through clearly who you are and what you want.<br/>
    To think about the skills that you will need to build a wonderful life and career and<br/>
    then to work every day on becoming better and better at something that is important to you.
</p>

<p>
    What happens is as as you feel better and better in these skill areas,<br/>
    people will compliment you and say 'you know you're very good at that' or<br/>
    'you did a good job at that' or they'll stand back and be amazed.<br/>
    And as they admire you for your improving skills,<br/>
    your self confidence in your ability to do that thing goes up and up.
</p>

<h2>Envy</h2>

<p>
    When you stop focusing on your growth and<br/>
    start getting bothered about other people's growth,<br/>
    a person will become envious.<br/>
    Envy is a self destructive emotion.<br/>
    Envy results from feeling deprived not necessarily because you don't have enough;<br/>
    but because someone has more.
</p>

<p>
    Being around people who are happy, healthy or wealthy;<br/>
    when you are in pain stricken with a debilitating illness or deprived of an income can easily stir feelings of envy.
</p>

<p>
    When you feel envious, interrogate yourself.<br/>
    Unlock the boons from this unpleasant emotion.<br/>
    Ask yourself, some self-improvement questions.<br/>
    How can I make my life better than what it used to be?<br/>
    What are my new goals and what course of action must I take to fulfill my goals?<br/>
    What skills must I develop in order to succeed?<br/>
    What is it that I can do to contribute to the world?
    <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：感到嫉妒，应该从自己身上寻找，寻找可以提升能力的空间。</sub>
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<h2>Guilt</h2>

<p>
    The emotion of guilt, regret and remorse are among the emotions human beings do most to avoid in life.
    And this is valuable.
</p>

<p>
    Healthy guilt occurs when you hurt or wronged another person or yourself.<br/>
    You regret your actions and feel undeserving, wrong, stupid, ashamed, sorry or disappointed in yourself.<br/>
    It occurs when your anger is turned inward.
</p>

<p>
    When you experience the emotion of guilt;<br/>
    it tells you to fix certain things in life that are fixable and solvable.<br/>
    It invokes your commitment to rise above your expectations.<br/>
    It tells you never again.<br/>
    It tells you no more of this or enough is enough.
</p>

<p>
    You feel regretful when you didn't take the action you should have or<br/>
    you took the wrong move violating your gut feelings.<br/>
    Guilt tells you that you violated one of your own highest standards and<br/>
    that you must do something immediately to ensure that<br/>
    you're not going to violate that standard again in the future.
</p>

<p>
    When guilt is not handled properly it can turn into resentment.
</p>

<h2>Unforgiveness</h2>

<p>
    Unforgiveness is a toxic emotion
    because it does more harm to the person who is not willing to forgive.
</p>

<p>
    Forgiveness can be a very difficult step but one that may be essential to your getting emotional closure.<br/>
    Forgiveness is a liberating experience.<br/>
    Forgiveness sets you free.
</p>

<p>
    Remember to analyze these.<br/>
    You haven't forgiven:<br/>
    when you still have regrets,<br/>
    when you're not on talking terms with someone,<br/>
    when you still hold grudges towards someone,<br/>
    when you still hold someone responsible for all your problems,<br/>
    when you still have not accepted the reality,<br/>
    when you hold negative energy towards someone or something,<br/>
    or when you say 'I can't forget the things he or she has done to me'.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="text-key-point">Forgiveness really means letting go.</span><br/>
    Well the reality is: <span class="text-key-point">If you go through life you're going to be hurt.</span><br/>
    The reality is every single one of us as human being has our weaknesses and<br/>
    we do the best that we can do<br/>
    based on where we are at in our level of consciousness and there level of humanity.<br/>
    And so if someone has hurt you and we've all been hurt.<br/>
    If someone has hurt you, please first of all,<br/>
    just remember they were doing the best<br/>
    that they knew how to do based on where they are at in their journey through life.<br/>
    <span class="text-key-point">So forgiving them is something that not only do they deserve
        but forgiving them as a gift you give yourself.</span>
</p>

<p>
    I once heard someone say "when you're going through life-
    I'm not having forgiven someone that has really hurt you;
    it's like you're carrying that person through life on your back".
</p>

<p>
    Forgiveness is not a feeling that you must passively wait to wash over you.<br/>
    It is a deliberate choice to free yourself from the burden of bitterness, anger and hatred.<br/>
    When you forgive someone, you're literally setting a prisoner free.<br/>
    The greatest human goal is peace of mind and<br/>
    the greatest obstacle to peace of mind is anger and blame aimed at other people.
</p>

<p>
    In order to eliminate anger and blame you have to learn to forgive.<br/>
    And <span class="text-key-point">there are four people that you need to forgive</span><br/>
    if you're really serious about changing your life and learning how to live in the present.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="text-key-point">The first people you have to forgive are your parents living or dead.</span><br/>
    You must absolutely forgive them for every mistake they ever made in bringing you up.<br/>
    At the very least you should be grateful to them for giving you life.<br/>
    They got you here.<br/>
    If you're happy to be alive you can forgive them for everything else.<br/>
    Never complain about them again.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="text-key-point">The second persons you must forgive are the people from your marriages or relationships that didn't work out.</span><br/>
    These intimate relationships can be so intense and so threatening to your feelings of self-esteem and self-worth<br/>
    that you can become angry and unforgiving toward these people for years.<br/>
    But remember you were at least partially responsible for the relationships in your life that didn't work out.<br/>
    Have the personal strength and integrity to say those magic words 'I am responsible' and<br/>
    then think of ways that you were responsible for the relationship rather than<br/>
    thinking of reasons why the other person is to blame.<br/>
    Forgive the other person and let him or her go.<br/>
    Say these words 'I forgive him or her for everything and I wish him or her well'.<br/>
    Each time you repeat this but negative emotion attached to the memory will be diminished,<br/>
    almost like turning down the heat on a pot.<br/>
    It gets cooler and cooler and soon it will be gone forever.
</p>

<p>
    Now <span class="text-key-point">the third person you must forgive is everyone else in your life who has ever hurt you in any way.</span><br/>
    Let them go.<br/>
    Forgive every boss, every business partner, friend or crook or betrayer who has ever caused you grief of any kind.<br/>
    Clean the slate and forgive and forget.<br/>
    Wipe away each of their names and wipe the images off by just saying<br/>
    whenever you think of "I forgive him or her for everything, I wish them well".<br/>
    I forgive them for everything and I wish them well.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="text-key-point">The fourth and final person you have to forgive is yourself.</span><br/>
    You must absolutely forgive yourself for every silly, senseless, wicked,<br/>
    brainless, thoughtless, or cool thing that you've ever done or said.<br/>
    Stop carrying these past mistakes around with you.<br/>
    That was then, and this is now.<br/>
    Think of it this way.<br/>
    When you did those things in the past, that you still feel badly about,<br/>
    you were not the person that you are today.<br/>
    At that time you're a different person.<br/>
    You're younger and less experienced.<br/>
    You are not your true self- as you are today.<br/>
    You were an immature version of the person that you have become, with experience.<br/>
    So stop beating yourself up for something that occurred in the past-<br/>
    something that a different person did.<br/>
    Not you and something that you cannot change.
</p>

<p>
    Take control of your emotions.<br/>
    Name them, tame them and use them to direct your life to greater advantage.<br/>
    When you feel an unpleasant emotion, talk back to that emotion.<br/>
    When you feel angry, ask yourself a question- what am i angry about?<br/>
    When you feel low, ask yourself: What am I sad about?<br/>
    How can I be joyful at this very moment? What are these feelings trying to teach me?<br/>
    What is the hidden message in this emotion?<br/>
    You are the source of all your feelings and always responsible for your emotional responses.<br/>
    So make your primary focus internal.<br/>
    Blaming others for your feelings is a waste of your energy.
</p>

<p>
    Remember people and situations can only trigger what is already inside you.<br/>
    When you get angry people are triggering the existing anger inside you.<br/>
    When you feel sad, people and situations are already triggering the sadness inside you you.<br/>
    You laugh when your inner joy is turned on.<br/>
    Next time when you're triggered to experience an unpleasant emotion,<br/>
    you can ask: What do I need and want above all else here? What are my options here?<br/>
    What's the best way to deal with these feelings right now?<br/>
    What's the best way to resolve these recurring feelings?<br/>
    When you intelligently respond to your emotions,<br/>
    you can find the hidden messages of what that emotion is trying to communicate to you.
