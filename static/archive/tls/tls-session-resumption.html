    The server was responsible for assigning a unique session
    ID to each TLS connection. Why does the server generate it, then?

    SSL, since v2, has always supported <strong>session resumption</strong>. Remember that SSL
    was originally conceived as an HTTP add-on; it was only later retrofitted to
    other protocols. It was also designed back when HTTP 1.0 was state-of-the-art<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">最新进的技术</sub>,
    and HTTP 1.0 required the web client — the browser — to close the socket connection
    to indicate the end of request. This meant that a lot of HTTP requests
    needed to be made for even a single web page. Although this was corrected
    somewhat in HTTP 1.1 with pipelining of requests/keepalives, the fact still
    remains that HTTP has a very low data-to-socket ratio. Add the time it takes to
    do a key exchange and the corresponding private key operations, and SSL can
    end up being a major drain<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">消耗；耗竭；耗费 a thing that uses a lot of the time, money, etc. that could be used for sth else</sub> on the throughput of the system.
    <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：session ID的作用就是为了session resumption。在使用TLS时，如果每一次建立连接都进行key exchange，会对性能产生很大消耗。</sub>

    To get a handle on this, SSL, and TLS, allow keying material to be reused
    across multiple sockets. This works by passing an old session ID in the client
    hello message and short-circuiting the handshake. This allows the lifetime of
    the SSL session — the keying material that's used to protect the data — to be
    independent of the lifetime of the socket. Regardless of the protocol used, this
    is a good thing. After a 128-bit key has been successfully negotiated, depending
    on the cipher spec, it can be used to protect potentially hundreds of thousands
    of bytes of content. There's no reason to throw away these carefully negotiated
    keys just because the top-level protocol itself has ended.

<p class="indented">
    The following figure shows that the <em>certificate</em>, <em>server hello done</em>, and <em>key exchange messages</em>
    have all been elided. Because the client and the server have already negotiated
    a master secret, there's no reason to resend these parameters.

<p class="indented">
    Interestingly, when the handshake is shortened for session resumption, the
    server sends the <em>finished message</em> first, whereas for a normal handshake,
    it's the client. This is a nod to efficiency: The server
    needn't wait for the client to send a key exchange before it computes its finished
    message, so it can go ahead and pipeline all three of its messages in a single
    burst if the server is willing to renegotiate.
    <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：在使用resumption的情况下，server会先发送finished message。</sub>
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    What if the server isn't willing to renegotiate? According to the specification,
    the server should go ahead and silently begin a new handshake, and send its
    <em>certificate</em> and <em>server hello done</em> message. It's technically up to the client if it wants to
    abort at this point, or go ahead and just negotiate a new session. In most cases,
    the client wants to continue anyway. It's hard to imagine a scenario where a
    client wouldn't want to negotiate a new session in this case. All TLS-based
    software that I'm familiar with automatically does so, without prompting or
    notifying the user. It's possible, though, that some particularly security-conscious
    (say, military) software somewhere may say, “Hey, you gave me this session ID
    two minutes ago, and now you're not willing to resume it? Something's wrong
    here, I'm bailing,” and notify the user to investigate what could possibly be a
    security breach.

    The TLS specification, RFC 2246, mandates that if a session was not shut down
    correctly — if the client didn't send a close notify alert before shutting down the
    socket — then the session should be marked non-resumable and attempts to resume
    it should fail. From section 7.2.1 of the RFC, which discusses the <code>close_notify</code> alert:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        close_notify: This message notifies the recipient that the sender will not send any more
        messages on this connection. The session becomes unresumable if any connection
        is terminated without proper <code>close_notify</code> messages with level equal to <code>warning</code>.
    </li>
</ul>

<p class="indented">
    This was not widely implemented, and later versions of the specification
    rescinded this requirement. However, to be technically compliant with RFC
    2246, this implementation ought to include this requirement when the negotiated protocol version is 3.1.
