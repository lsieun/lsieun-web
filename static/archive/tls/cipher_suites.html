    There’s no particular reason to the identifiers assigned to the various cipher suites.
    They’re just a sequential list of every combination that the writers of the specification could think of.
    They’re not even grouped together meaningfully;
    the RSA key exchange cipher suites aren’t all in the same place because after the specification was drafted,
    new cipher suites that used the RSA key exchange method were identified.
    It would certainly have been nicer, from an implementer’s perspective, if they had allocated, say,
    three bits to identify the key exchange, five bits to identify the symmetric cipher, two for the MAC, and so on.

<h2>TLS_NULL_WITH_NULL_NULL</h2>

<p class="indented">
    <code>TLS_NULL_WITH_NULL_NULL</code> indicates that there’s no encryption, no MAC and no key exchange.
    This is the default state for a TLS handshake — the state it starts out in.
    Cipher suites <code>TLS_RSA_WITH_NULL_MD5</code> and <code>TLS_RSA_WITH_NULL_SHA</code> allow a non-encrypted, but MAC’ed, cipher suite to be negotiated.
    This can actually be pretty handy when you’re trying to debug something and you don’t want to have to decrypt what you’re trying to debug.
    Unfortunately for the would-be debugger, for obvious security reasons, most servers won’t allow you to negotiate this cipher suite by default.
