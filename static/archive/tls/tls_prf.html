    In several places during the TLS negotiation,  the algorithm calls for a lot of data to be generated deterministically
    so that both sides agree on the same result, based on a seed.
    This process is referred to as <strong>pseudo-random</strong>.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    TLS has a fairly complex pseudo-random function called the <strong>PRF</strong> that generates data
    from a seed in such a way that two compliant implementations, given the same
    seed data, generate the same data, but that the output is randomly distributed
    and follows no observable pattern.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    It should come as no surprise at this point that this pseudo-random function
    is based on secure hash algorithms, which deterministically generate output
    from input in a non-predictable way. TLS’s PRF is actually based on the <strong>HMAC</strong>
    algorithm. It takes as input three values: <strong>the seed</strong>, <strong>a label</strong>, and <strong>a secret</strong>. The seed
    and the label are both used as input to the HMAC algorithm.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    The PRF for TLS v1.0 involves both MD5 and SHA-1 (and the use of these
    specific hash algorithms is hard-coded into the specification). MD5 and SHA-1
    are each used, along with the HMAC algorithm, to generate an arbitrary quantity of output independently. Then the results of both
    the MD5 HMAC and the SHA HMAC are XORed together to produce the final
    result. The secret is split up so that the MD5 routine gets the first half and the
    SHA routine gets the second half:
