<h2>Why?</h2>

<p class="indented">
    One of the most important of TLS extensions is the <b>server
    name indication (SNI)</b> extension. It's common in today's Internet for low-traffic
    websites to share a hosting provider. There's no particular reason why a
    blog that gets a few hundred hits a day needs a dedicated server; it can share
    bandwidth (and costs) with several other sites on a single host. However,
    this can pose problems for TLS. Each physical server on the Internet has its
    own IP address, even if that physical host maps to multiple domains. So, for
    instance, if a shared hosting provider had three hosts named <i>www.hardware.com</i>,
    <i>www.books.com</i>, and <i>www.computers.com</i>, all hosted from a single physical server,
    each one would resolve to the same IP address.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    This doesn't seem like a problem for TLS until you consider that TLS must
    send a certificate whose domain name matches the requested domain name
    to avoid the man-in-the-middle attack. However, TLS
    doesn't know what domain was requested. <strong>Domain names are for people;
    computers deal in IP addresses.</strong> Therefore, the client has to have some way to notify
    the server that it should present the certificate for <i>www.books.com</i> rather than the
    certificate for <i>www.computers.com</i>; wildcard certificates don't help here, because
    it's specifically prohibited to generate a wildcard of the form <i>*.com</i> — for obvious reasons.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Therefore, the client is optionally permitted to indicate with a client hello
    extension the name of the host it's trying to connect to, and all modern browsers do this.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    TLS does not provide a mechanism for a client to tell a server the
    name of the server it is contacting.  It may be desirable for clients
    to provide this information to facilitate secure connections to
    servers that host multiple 'virtual' servers at a single underlying
    network address.

<h2>Server Name(RFC 3546)</h2>

<p class="indented">
    In order to provide the server name, clients MAY include an extension
    of type "server_name" in the (extended) client hello.  The
    "extension_data" field of this extension SHALL contain
    "ServerNameList".

<div title="ServerNameList" class="plaintext">
struct {
    ServerName server_name_list<1..2^16-1>
} ServerNameList;

struct {
    NameType name_type;
    select (name_type) {
        case host_name: HostName;
    } name;
} ServerName;

enum {
    host_name(0), (255)
} NameType;

opaque HostName<1..2^16-1>;
