<h2>TLS Overview</h2>

<p>SSL = Secure Sockets Layer. Developed by Netscape in mid 1990s.</p>

<ul>
    <li>SSLv1 broken at birth.</li>
    <li>SSLv2 flawed in several ways, now IETF-deprecated (RFC 6176). </li>
    <li>SSLv3 now considered broken (POODLE + RC4 attacks), but still widely supported.</li>
</ul>

<p>TLS = Transport Layer Security. IETF-standardised version of SSL. </p>

<ul>
    <li>TLS 1.0 in RFC 2246 (1999). </li>
    <li>TLS 1.1 in RFC 4346 (2006). </li>
    <li>TLS 1.2 in RFC 5246 (2008). (major version)</li>
    <li>TLS 1.3 in RFC 8446 (2018). </li>
</ul>

<p class="indented">
    The TLS 1.0 protocol stood untouched for seven years after it was standardized
    in 1999. In 2006, Tim Dierks and Eric Rescorla drafted RFC 4346, specifying TLS
    1.1 and making TLS 1.0 obsolete.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    By and large, TLS 1.1 is not a significant change from TLS 1.0. It added some
    new cipher suites and some clarifications and implementation notes, but the
    most important change is that initialization vectors are no longer computed
    from the master secret; instead, they’re prepended to each packet.
    TLS 1.1 is not particularly common on the public Internet after it was drafted.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Two years after TLS 1.1 was drafted, it was made obsolete by RFC 5246, which
    specifies TLS 1.2. TLS 1.2 was a major modification of the TLS protocol.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    TLS 1.2 was formally specified in 2008 after several years of debate. It represents
    a significant change to its predecessor TLS 1.1 — mostly in terms of increased
    security options and additional cipher suite choices.
</p>

<h2>Importance of TLS</h2>

<p>Originally designed for secure e-commerce, now used much more widely. </p>

<ul>
    <li>Retail customer access to online banking facilities. </li>
    <li>Access to gmail, facebook, Yahoo, etc. </li>
    <li>Mobile applications, including banking apps. </li>
    <li>Payment infrastructures. </li>
</ul>

<p>TLS has become the de facto secure protocol of choice. </p>

<ul>
    <li>Used by hundreds of millions of people and devices every day. </li>
    <li>So we need to analyse it, in order to find and remove flaws.</li>
</ul>
