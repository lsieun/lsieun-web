<h2>Intro</h2>

<p class="indented">
    The high level impact of the <strong>TLS Renegotiation Attack</strong> is that an attacker can
    arrange to inject traffic into a legitimate client-server exchange such that
    the TLS server will accept it as if it came from the client. This may allow
    the attacker to execute operations on the server using the client's credentials
    (e.g., order a pizza as the client). However, the attacker does not (generally)
    get to see the response. Obviously this isn't good, but it's not the end of the world.

<h2>Attack Details</h2>

<p class="indented">
    The attack exploits TLS's renegotiation feature, which allows a client and server
    who already have a TLS connection to negotiate new parameters, generate new keys,
    etc. Renegotiation is carried out in the existing TLS connection, with the new
    handshake packets being encrypted along with application packets. The difficulty
    is that they're not otherwise tied to the channel, which gives the attacker a
    window. The simplest form of the attack is shown below
</p>

<div title="renegotiation attack" class="plaintext">
Client                        Attacker                        Server
------                        -------                         ------
                                  <----------- Handshake ---------->
                                  <======= Initial Traffic ========>
<--------------------------  Handshake ============================>
<======================== Client Traffic ==========================>
</div>

<p class="indented">
    So, in order to mount the attack, the attacker first connects to the TLS
    server. He can communicate with the server as much as he wants, including
    making an arbitrary number of requests/responses, etc. This traffic is all
    encrypted and shown as <code>==</code>. Then when he's ready, he hijacks
    the client's connection to the server (in practice he might start by hijacking
    the connection and then connect to the server but it doesn't matter) and
    just proxies the client's traffic over the encrypted channel. The client
    negotiates with the server and from that point on the client and the server
    communicate directly. Note that the client is communicating with the attacker
    in the clear but the second handshake is encrypted and goes over the attacker's
    channel. Thus, the client does not know that he is renegotiating. However,
    the server thinks that the initial traffic with the attacker is also from
    the client. There are also other (probably less useful) variants where both
    sides see a renegotiation but of different connections.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    TLS itself is just a security protocol, so the impact of this attack depends
    on the application protocol running over TLS. The most important of these
    protocols is of course HTTP over TLS (HTTPS). Most Web applications do initial
    authentication via a username/password pair and then persist that authentication
    state with HTTP cookies (a secret token that is sent with any request). An attacker
    might exploit this issue by sending a partial HTTP request of his own that
    requested some resource. This then gets prefixed to the client's real request.

</p>

<p class="indented">
    E.g., the attacker would send:
</p>

<div title="attacker" class="plaintext">
GET /pizza?toppings=pepperoni;address=attackersaddress HTTP/1.1
X-Ignore-This:
</div>

<p>
    And leave the last line empty without a carriage return line feed. Then when
    the client makes his own request
</p>

<div title="victim" class="plaintext">
GET /pizza?toppings=sausage;address=victimssaddress HTTP/1.1
Cookie: victimscookie
</div>

<p>
    the two requests get glued together into:
</p>

<div title="server" class="plaintext">
GET /pizza?toppings=pepperoni;address=attackersaddress HTTP/1.1
X-Ignore-This: GET /pizza?toppings=sausage;address=victimssaddress HTTP/1.1
Cookie: victimscookie
</div>

<p>
    And the server uses the victim's account to send a pizza to the attacker.

</div>

<p class="indented">
    It's important to note that the attacker doesn't get to see any sensitive
    information directly: that's just sent back encrypted to the client. However, he
    can exploit side effects of the exchange, e.g., to get a pizza. It may also
    be possible to exploit HTTP features to directly access the data. For instance, he
    might be able to generate a combined request that would cause the server (or perhaps
    somehow mirrored through the client) to send the original client request to the
    attacker. If the request contains the client's cookie or password, this would cause
    their credentials to leak. It's not clear to me if this is possible, but I'm
    hoping some of the Web security specialists will weigh in.

<h2>Attack Mitigation</h2>

<p class="indented">
    For 99+% of applications, the mitigation is very simple: the server should
    simply disable all renegotiation, which stops the attack. Unfortunately, there
    is no similar defense on the client side. The client is unaware that renegotiation
    happened. Moreover, the client can't tell that the server will refuse
    renegotiation (it could explicitly probe but the attacker could of course
    fake a failure). So, the client can't really do anything useful to protect itself.
    <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：对于server来说，只要disable这个renegotiation就行了；但是，对于client来说，却无技可施。</sub>
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    There are a small number of cases where renegotiation
    actually should happen. The most practical defense on the server side is to
    restructure the site so that requests which require client auth are redirected
    to a different address or port which always requests a certificate and itself
    refuses renegotiation. However, this obviously requires major work on many sites.
    <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：在有些场景下，需要在server端开启renegotiation。</sub>
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    There are a few other legitimate reasons for renegotiation, but they're mostly
    things one doesn't need to do. For instance, people sometimes renegotiate to
    force the generation of fresh keying material. This is not necessary with
    modern cryptographic algorithms. Another example provided by Ray is sites
    that support algorithms with differential strength. Again, this isn't really
    necessary. It's very unlikely you need to renegotiate.
    <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：而在其他场景下，server端开启renegotiation没有很大的必要。</sub>
