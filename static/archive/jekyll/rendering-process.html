<p>
    For any Jekyll site, a <b>build session</b> consists of discrete phases in the following order — <b>setting up plugins,
    reading source files, running generators, rendering templates</b>, and finally <b>writing files to disk</b>.
</p>

<p>
    While the phases above are self-explanatory, the one phase that warrants dissection is <b>the rendering phase</b>.
</p>

<p>
    The <b>rendering phase</b> is further divisible into three optional stages.<br/>
    Every file rendered, passes through one or more of these stages as determined by the file’s content string, front matter and extension.<br/>
    The stages are akin to an assembly line, with the <b>output</b> from a stage being the <b>input</b> for the succeeding stage:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Interpreting Liquid expressions in the file</strong><br>
        This stage evaluates Liquid expressions in the current file.<br/>
        By default, the interpretation is <b>shallow</b> — in that<br/>
        any Liquid expression in resulting output is not further interpreted.<br/>
        Moreover, any Liquid expression in the file’s front matter is left untouched.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Unleashing the converters</strong><br>
        This stage invokes the converter mapped to the current file’s extension and converts the input string.<br/>
        This is when Markdown gets converted into HTML and<br/>
        Sass/Scss into CSS or<br/>
        CoffeeScript into JavaScript, etc, etc.<br/>
        Since this stage is determined by the file’s extension,<br/>
        Markdown or Sass inside a <code>.html</code> file will remain untouched.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Populating the layouts</strong><br>
        By this stage, <em>the source file</em> is considered rendered and it will not be revisited.<br/>
        However, based on the file’s extension and consequently based on the front matter,<br/>
        it is determined whether to take the <b>output</b> string from the preceding stage and place into layouts or not.<br/>
        Whereas output from Sass files or CoffeeScript files are <b>never</b> placed into a layout,<br/>
        regular text output can go either ways based on whether a layout has been assigned via the front matter.<br><br>
        Placement into layouts work similar to how Russian dolls encase the smaller ones within itself or how an oyster
        generates a pearl — the converted output from the preceding stage forms the core and layout(s) are successively
        <em>rendered</em> separately onto the core.
    </li>
</ul>
