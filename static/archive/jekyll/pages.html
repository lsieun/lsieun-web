<p>
    Pages are the most basic building block for content.<br/>
    They're useful for standalone content<br/>
    (content which is not date based or is not a group of content such as staff members or recipes).
</p>

<p>
    The simplest way of adding a page is to add an HTML file in the root directory with a suitable filename.<br/>
    You can also write a page in Markdown using a <code>.md</code> extension which converts to HTML on build.<br/>
    For a site with a homepage, an about page, and a contact page,<br/>
    here's what the root directory and associated URLs might look like:
</p>

<pre title="root directory" class="plaintext">
.
├── about.md    # => http://example.com/about.html
├── index.html    # => http://example.com/
└── contact.html  # => http://example.com/contact.html
</pre>

<p>
    If you have a lot of pages, you can organize them into subfolders.<br/>
    The same subfolders<br/>
    that are used to group your pages in your project's source<br/>
    will then exist in the <code>_site</code> folder when your site builds.<br/>
    However, when a page has a <b>different</b> permalink set in the front matter,<br/>
    the subfolder at <code>_site</code> changes accordingly.
</p>

<pre title="root directory" class="plaintext">
.
├── about.md          # => http://example.com/about.html
├── documentation     # folder containing pages
│   └── doc1.md       # => http://example.com/documentation/doc1.html
├── design            # folder containing pages
│   └── draft.md      # => http://example.com/design/draft.html
</pre>

<h2 id="changing-the-output-url">Changing the output URL</h2>

<p>
    You might want to have a particular folder structure for your source files that changes for the built site.<br/>
    With <a href="permalinks.html">permalinks</a> you have full control of the output URL.
</p>

<h2 id="excerpts-for-pages">Excerpts for pages</h2>

<p>
    From Jekyll 4.1.1 onwards, one can <b>choose</b> to generate excerpts for their pages by setting <code>page_excerpts</code> to <code>true</code> in their
    config file.
