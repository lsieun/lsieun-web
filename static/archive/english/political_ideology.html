<h2>Ideology</h2>

<p>
    An ideology is a set of opinions or beliefs of a group or an individual. Very often ideology refers to a set of political beliefs or a set of ideas that characterize a particular culture.
</p>

<p>
    Capitalism, communism, socialism, and Marxism are ideologies.
</p>

<h2>Capitalism</h2>

<p>
    Capitalism is an economic system featuring the private ownership of business wealth and the free and unfettered<sub class="my_note" style="color:green">无限制的；不受约束的</sub> operation of trade markets.
</p>

<p>
    In a capitalist economy, the capital is owned by private individuals, as opposed to the government or state (as in socialism or communism).
</p>

<p>
    Another important aspect of capitalism is the "free market," where in theory natural competition always leads to innovation and price controls.
</p>

<h2>Communism</h2>

<p>
    At the opposite end of the spectrum from capitalism, communism is an economic theory favoring a classless society and the abolition of private property.
</p>

<p>
    Communism derives from the French commun (common). Ideally, according to communism, society shares all property in common, everyone shares the burden of labor, and everyone shares the profits of that labor.
</p>

<p>
    As a system of government, communism is often closer to a form of socialism, in which the state owns and operates industry on behalf of the people.
</p>

<h2>Socialism</h2>

<p>
    Because the Soviet state eventually strayed far from Marx's idea of socialism towards Lenin's totalitarian communism, socialism is now often used to mean everything from "fascism" to "progressivism."
</p>

<p>
    But in its purest form, socialism was a political, social, and economic system meant to empower the working class.
</p>

<h2>Stalinism</h2>

<p>
    the policies and beliefs of Stalin, especially that the Communist party should be the only party and that the central government should control the whole political and economic system.
</p>

<h3>personality cult</h3>

<p>
    a situation in which people are encouraged to show extreme love and admiration for a famous person, especially a political leader 个人迷信；个人崇拜
</p>

<h2>Fascism</h2>

<p>
    Fascism is a way of ruling that advocates total control of the people.
</p>

<p>
    In fascism, the people are looked at as a bundle — one body that must be controlled by the government with absolute force. There’s no option to vote, no chance to impeach(指责；责难) a leader, and no freedom to stand up against the governing body.
</p>

<p>
    an extreme right-wing political system or attitude which is in favour of strong central government and which does not allow any opposition
</p>

<h2>Totalitarianism</h2>

<p>
    If the government has complete and absolute power over the people, that's totalitarianism. This is a repressive(压抑的；抑制的), unfree type of society.
</p>

<p>
    A democracy is a society in which people have a say in their government and elect their leaders. The opposite is totalitarianism: a totalitarian society is usually ruled by a dictator, and there is very little or no freedom. In totalitarianism, the government controls almost every aspect of life. There is no free speech or freedom of the press: certain religions and ideas may be banned. George Orwell's novel 1984 was a brilliant look at a world of totalitarianism.
</p>

<h2>Authoritarianism</h2>

<p>
    Political scientists use the term authoritarianism to describe a way of governing that values order and control over personal freedom. A government run by authoritarianism is usually headed by a dictator(独裁者).
</p>

<p>
    The noun authoritarianism is most often used in a negative context, to describe a government with absolute control over the population. This kind of government uses military threats, suppression of a free press, and disinformation(故意的假情报) to manage the people over whom it rules. Many people consider China to be an example of an authoritarian government today. The word itself can be traced back to the Latin auctor, "master, leader, or author."
</p>

<h2>Imperialism</h2>

<p>
    Imperialism is a type of government that seeks to increase its size, either by forcing (through war) or influencing (through politics) other countries to submit to their rule.
</p>

<p>
    The sun never sets on the Roman Empire, or so went the saying when Rome controlled the majority of Europe 2000 years ago. Empire has the same Latin root as imperialism, and the Roman Empire grew to be so vast because they invaded, conquered, and developed everywhere they could. Until Rome fell, that is. Imperialism isn’t always violent, but it’s usually used in a negative sense, so watch for secret agents if you’re talking about your country’s policy of imperialism.
</p>

<p>
    Authoritarianism is the opposite of individualism in democracy, marked by submission to authority. In this system, the political power is condensed into one authority figure, who has unchecked power. Totalitarianism is when the person in power seeks to control every aspect of public and private life.
</p>

<h2>Individualism</h2>

<p>
    the belief that individual people in society should have the right to make their own decisions, etc., rather than be controlled by the government.
</p>

<p>
    Individualism is all about taking care of yourself; it is the belief and practice that every person is unique and self-reliant. A belief in individualism also implies that you believe that the government should bud out of your individual affairs.
</p>

<p>
    The concept of individualism is rooted in historical contexts where people’s personal differences were dismissed or even punished by the ruling body. In particular, the United States is known for having a strong bent towards individualism because it was founded by people who sought the freedom to practice whatever religion they chose. The counterpoints to individualism are socialism and communism (among others). Those who prefer individualism often site fear of governmental control over their life decisions as reason for that inclination.
