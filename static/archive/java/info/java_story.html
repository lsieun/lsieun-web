<h3>2010, Re-thinking JDK 7</h3>

<div class="w3-panel w3-border w3-border-blue">

        <a class="external" href="https://mreinhold.org/blog/rethinking-jdk7" target="_blank">Re-thinking JDK 7</a>, 2010/09/08
    </p>
    <p>
        It's been clear for some time that the most recent JDK 7 development schedule is, to put it mildly, unrealistic.
        <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：Java 7 development schedule is unrealistic</sub>
        <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
    </p>
    <p>
        We created that schedule over nine months ago, prior to the acquisition of Sun by Oracle.
        The post-acquisition integration process took longer than any of us anticipated, unfortunately,
        but we're now ready and able to focus on this release with a larger (and still growing) staff which will continue to work in the open alongside other contributors.
        <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：计划是9个月之前定的，实际的情形与原计划差异很大</sub>
        <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
    </p>
    <p>
        So, whither JDK 7?
        <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：那么，Java 7将何去何从呢？</sub>
        <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
    </p>
    <p>
        Our present best estimate is that we could complete, test, and stabilize the planned work in time for a release around the middle of 2012.
        <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：如果Java 7要完成全部的功能，现在是2010年，那么最乐观的估计是要到2012年才能实现。</sub>
        <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
    </p>
    <p>
        Looking at what's in the forest today, however, much of that work is in fact already done, or very nearly so.
        <b>The main outstanding items are the Lambda and Jigsaw Projects, along with a few of the Coin proposals.</b>
        We've made a lot of progress on these features, and they now have more Oracle engineers working on them than before,
        <b>but significant work remains to be done.</b>
        <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：没有实现的主要功能是Lambda项目、Jigsaw项目和Coin项目的一部分。</sub>
        <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
    </p>
    <p>
        Another possibility, therefore, is to take everything we have now, test and stabilize it, and ship that as JDK 7.
        We could then finish Lambda, Jigsaw, the rest of Coin, and maybe a few additional key features in a JDK 8 release which would ship fairly soon thereafter.
        <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：另一种可能的实现是，将现有的功能作为JDK 7进行发布，而Lambda、Jigsaw等功能留到JDK 8版本来实现。</sub>
        <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
    </p>
    <p>
        This approach would give developers production-quality access to the nearly-finished features sooner rather than later, and with much less risk.
        It would also allow more time to really shake out Lambda and Jigsaw, which is critical given that these higher-risk efforts are making deep changes to the very foundations of the platform.
        <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：这种实现思路，从时间上来说更快，从风险上来说更低。</sub>
        <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
    </p>
    <p>
        Our current estimate for this “Plan B” is that we could ship a reduced JDK 7 in mid-2011 and JDK 8 in the second half of 2012.
    </p>
    <p>To summarize:</p>
    <table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse;">
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Plan A:</td>
            <td>JDK 7 (as currently defined)</td>
            <td>Mid 2012</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td rowspan="2">Plan B:</td>
            <td>
                JDK 7 (minus Lambda, Jigsaw, and part of Coin)
            </td>
            <td>Mid 2011</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                JDK 8 (Lambda, Jigsaw, the rest of Coin, ++)
            </td>
            <td>Late 2012</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
        Here at Oracle we’re leaning heavily toward the lower-risk Plan B.
        The platform has been idle for (more than!) long enough—it’s time to get Java moving again.
        If there are good reasons to prefer Plan A, however, then I’d like to hear them.

<h3>Project Coin</h3>

        <a class="external" href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/coin/" target="_blank">OpenJDK: Project Coin</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        The goal of Project Coin is to determine what set of small language changes should be added to JDK 7. That list is:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Strings in switch</li>
        <li>Binary integral literals and underscores in numeric literals</li>
        <li>Multi-catch and more precise rethrow</li>
        <li>Improved type inference for generic instance creation (diamond)</li>
        <li>try-with-resources statement</li>
        <li>Simplified varargs method invocation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The previously selected features of collections support and unsigned literals have been deferred and will be reconsidered in JDK 8.

    </p>
    <p>
        As promised I’ve posted a <a class="external" href="http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~mr/lambda/straw-man" target="_blank">straw-man proposal</a> to extend Java with first-class functions, function types, and lambda expressions (informally, “closures”) to the newly-created <a class="external" href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/lambda" target="_blank">Project Lambda</a> page.
    </p>

    <i>
        A <b>straw-man proposal</b> is a brainstormed simple draft proposal intended to generate discussion of its disadvantages and to provoke the generation of new and better proposals.
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        Often, a straw man document will be prepared by one or two people prior to kicking off a larger project.
        In this way, the team can jump start their discussions with a document that is likely to contain many, but not all, of the key aspects to be discussed.
        As the document is revised, it may be given other edition names such as the more solid-sounding "<b>stone-man</b>", "<b>iron-man</b>", and so on.

<h2>2017, Java 9</h2>

<h3>The Curse of Project Jigsaw</h3>

<div class="w3-panel w3-border w3-border-blue">
    <p>
        <a class="external" href="https://www.overops.com/blog/the-curse-of-project-jigsaw-why-is-java-9-delayed-over-and-over-again/" target="_blank">The Curse of Project Jigsaw</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        It’s no surprise that JDK 9 has been pushed again, and for the same reason – Project Jigsaw.
        This project has a long history of pushing Java versions back,
        <a class="external" href="https://mreinhold.org/blog/on-the-next-train" target="_blank">moving from Java 7 to Java 8</a> and ending up as part of Java 9, hopefully.
    </p>
    <p>
        Jigsaw aims to make Java modular and break the JRE to interoperable components.
        This mean that you’ll be able to create a scaled down runtime Jar (<code>rt.jar</code>) customised to the components a project actually needs.
    </p>
    <p>
        The desire is to make Java scalable to small computing devices, improve security and performance,
        and mainly make it easier for developers to construct and maintain libraries.
        Considering the JDK 8 <code>rt.jar</code> has about 20,000 classes that are part of the JDK, even if many of them aren’t really being used in a specific environment – it’s a pretty big deal.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mark addressed the reason for the delay on his original email, explaining that:
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>
            “We recently received critical feedback that motivated a redesign of the module system’s package-export feature,
            without which we’d have failed to achieve one of our main goals.
            There are, beyond that, still many open design issues, which will take time to work through.”
        </i>
    </p>
    <p>
        The current pushback tells us loud and clear that Jigsaw needs more time,
        and our only hope is that it’ll actually be a part of JDK 9,
        and not be pushed back to JDK 10. Or JDK 11.
        There’s no doubt it’s a critical and important project, and the community is willing to wait a little longer for it to be just right.

<h3>2012, Project Jigsaw: On the next train</h3>

<div class="w3-panel w3-border w3-border-blue">

        <a class="external" href="https://mreinhold.org/blog/on-the-next-train" target="_blank">Project Jigsaw: On the next train</a>, 2012/09/21
    </p>
    <p>
        I recently proposed to defer Project Jigsaw from Java 8 to Java 9.
    </p>
    <p>
        Feedback on the proposal was about evenly divided as to whether Java 8 should be delayed for Jigsaw, Jigsaw should be deferred to Java 9, or some other, usually less-realistic, option should be taken.
    </p>
    <p>
        The ultimate decision rested, of course, with the Java SE 8 (JSR 337) Expert Group.
        After due consideration, a strong majority of the EG agreed to my proposal.
