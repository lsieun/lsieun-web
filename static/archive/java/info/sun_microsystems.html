<h2>Sun Microsystems:  A Culture of Innovation</h2>

<p>
    Sun has always been a company that prided itself on technical and business innovation.
    The company pioneered the Unix workstation, the Unix business server,
    the Java programming language, the RISC microprocessor, the “database server,”
    and in fact really popularized the whole concept of computers as “servers.”
    One could argue that much of the architecture of the internet (thin clients with highly scalable servers) was really invented by Sun.
    “The Network is the Computer,” one of Sun’s most memorable taglines, was way ahead of its time.
</p>
<p>
    But as our “enduring organization” research discusses, corporate cultures must change over time.
    As Microsoft and others started to dominate the corporate computing landscape,
    Sun failed to make the transition from a “pioneering” culture to a purely “market driven” culture.
    Rather than try to build more “complete products” for its existing customers, the company moved continuously into new, technology-driven markets.
    During my days at Sybase, Sun virtually owned the server and desktop business for Wall Street traders.
    But by not focusing on building complete solutions for this market,
    companies like IBM slowly entered and today this market is a far more heterogenous environment than Sun would like.
</p>

<h2>Oracle: A Pioneering Culture which has Shifted toward Market Leadership</h2>

<p>
    Oracle had very similar beginnings.
    The company revolutionized corporate computing by commercializing the standard SQL database (which was actually invented by IBM, much to IBM’s chagrin).
    Like Sun, Oracle is an engineering-driven company.
    In its early days the company focused on building the fastest, most feature-rich database in the market.
    Back in the days of the “database wars”, Oracle tenaciously and aggressively defended its technology leadership and
    made up for some of its technical flaws with a highly aggressive sales and marketing culture.
</p>
<p>
    Oracle learned, as perhaps Sun did not, that as the company becomes a market leader,
    it must integrate its operations and behave more like an end-to-end solutions company, not only a technology leader.
    Hence the company moved aggressively from IT infrastructure to applications, with the acquisition of a wide range of applications companies, including PeopleSoft.
</p>
<p>
    One cannot argue with Oracle’s astounding success.
    The company’s relentless focus on database allowed Oracle to force Sybase, Ingres, Informix, and even IBM out of the mid-market database industry.
    Today its only real competitors are Microsoft and OpenSQL (which the company now owns through the Sun acquisition).
</p>
<p>
    From a cultural perspective, Oracle and Sun have always aligned well.
    The companies jointly engineered one of the highest-performing combinations of hardware and software in the world of corporate applications – and have continued to work closely together over the years.
    (Oracle in fact works with all major hardware providers, just as Sun used to work closely with competing database providers.)
</p>
<p>
    But unlike Sun, Oracle evolved into a serious, solutions-driven enterprise software company.
    While we still see tremendous engineering focus in the company, Oracle now focuses on application software, vertical markets, and end-to-end business integration.
    Where Sun continues to define itself as an innovative provider of internet-based products and solutions,
    Oracle now defines itself as the “safe and reliable market leader” in enterprise software.
    This has not reduced Oracle’s fierce focus on sales and marketing – but has given the company a real culture of “business planning” and “market leadership.
