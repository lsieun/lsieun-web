<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p class="indented">
    Invoke Dynamic (Also known as Indy) was part of <a class="external" href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=292" target="_blank">JSR 292</a> intended to enhance the JVM support for dynamically typed languages.
    After its first release in Java 7, the <code>invokedynamic</code> opcode is used quite extensively by dynamic JVM-based languages like JRuby and even statically typed languages like Java.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Before Java 7, the JVM only had four method invocation types:
    <code>invokevirtual</code> to call normal class methods,
    <code>invokestatic</code> to call static methods,
    <code>invokeinterface</code> to call interface methods,
    and <code>invokespecial</code> to call constructors or private methods.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    <b>
        Despite their differences, all these invocations share one simple trait:
        They have a few predefined steps to complete each method call, and we can't enrich these steps with our custom behaviors.
    </b>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    There are two main workarounds for this limitation: One at compile-time and the other at runtime.
    The former is usually used by languages like Scala or Koltin and the latter is the solution of choice for JVM-based dynamic languages like JRuby.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    The runtime approach is usually reflection-based and consequently, inefficient.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    On the other hand, the compile-time solution is usually relying on code-generation at compile-time.
    This approach is more efficient at runtime.
    However, it's somewhat brittle and also may cause a slower startup time as there's more bytecode to process.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Now that we've got a better understanding of the problem, let's see how the solution works internally.
