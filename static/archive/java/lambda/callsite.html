<h2>Different Types of CallSites</h2>

<p class="indented">
    Once the JVM sees <code>invokedynamic</code> for the first time, it calls <b>the bootstrap method</b>.
    <b>The lambda bootstrap method will use the <code>InnerClassLambdaMetafactory</code> to generate an inner class for the lambda at runtime</b>.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Then the bootstrap method encapsulates the generated inner class inside a special type of <code>CallSite</code> known as <code>ConstantCallSite</code>.
    This type of <code>CallSite</code> would never change after setup.
    Therefore, after the first setup for each lambda, the JVM will always use the fast path to directly call the lambda logic.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Although this is the most efficient type of <code>invokedynamic</code>, it's certainly not the only available option.
    As a matter of fact, Java provides <code>MutableCallSite</code> and <code>VolatileCallSite</code> to accommodate for more dynamic requirements.
</p>

<h2>Advantages</h2>

<p class="indented">
    So, in order to implement <b>lambda expressions</b>, instead of creating <b>anonymous inner classes</b> at <b>compile-time</b>, Java creates them at <b>runtime</b> via <code>invokedynamic</code>.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    One might argue against deferring inner class generation until runtime.
    However, the <code>invokedynamic</code> approach has a few advantages over the simple compile-time solution.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    First, the JVM does not generate the inner class until the first use of lambda.
    Hence, <b>we won't pay for the extra footprint associated with the inner class before the first lambda execution.</b>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Additionally, much of the linkage logic is moved out from the bytecode to the bootstrap method.
    Therefore, <b>the <code>invokedynamic</code> bytecode is usually much smaller than alternative solutions.</b>
    The smaller bytecode can boost startup speed.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Suppose a newer version of Java comes with a more efficient bootstrap method implementation.
    <b>Then our <code>invokedynamic</code> bytecode can take advantage of this improvement without recompiling.</b>
    This way we can achieve some sort of forwarding binary compatibility.
    Basically, we can switch between different strategies without recompilation.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Finally, writing the bootstrap and linkage logic in Java is usually easier than traversing an AST to generate a complex piece of bytecode.
    So, <code>invokedynamic</code> can be (subjectively) less brittle.
</p>
