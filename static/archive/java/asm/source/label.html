    Since <code>Label</code> objects must be stored in several data structures at the same time,
    they have several distinct fields that encode these data structures:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        the <code>nextBasicBlock</code> field is used to encode the list of labels of a method, in the order they are visited.
    </li>
    <li>
        the <code>outgoingEdges</code> field is used to store the list of <code>Edge</code> objects
        (linked through their <code>nextEdge</code> field) that represent the control flow graph data structure.
    </li>
    <li>
        the <code>nextListElement</code> field is used to store temporary lists of labels in the algorithms
        used to compute <span class="text-compare-grey">the maximum stack size</span> and <span class="text-compare-grey">stack map frames</span> of methods.
    </li>
</ul>

<p class="indent">
    From a user point of view the <code>Label</code> class is used to <span class="text-compare-blue">reference instructions</span>.
    Internally it is used to store <span class="text-compare-green">the bytecode offset of an instruction</span>
    (i.e. the bytecode array index of the first byte of the instruction),
    and to compute <span class="text-compare-green">relative bytecode offsets</span>
    (i.e. the difference between the bytecode offsets of two instructions).
    It is also used to represent <span class="text-compare-blue">basic blocks</span>,
    which are used for the automatic computation of <span class="text-compare-grey">the maximum stack size</span>
    and of <span class="text-compare-grey">the stack map frames</span> of a method.

<h2>Jump instructions</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        Jump instructions
        <ul>
            <li>backward jump</li>
            <li>forward jump</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>forward jump</h3>

<p class="indent">
    Jump instructions such as <code>IFEQ</code> or <code>GOTO</code> are stored in bytecode
    as an opcode followed by a relative bytecode offset to the target instruction
    (this relative offset is the difference between the bytecode offset of the target instruction and the bytecode offset of the jump instruction).
    This relative offset can be computed easily in the case of a backward jump
    (i.e. a jump to an instruction that is before the jump instruction in the bytecode),
    but it cannot be computed at all in the case of a forward jump
    (i.e. a jump to an instruction that is after the jump instruction) since, in this case,
    the target instruction has not been visited yet, and so its bytecode offset is unknown.
    The case of forward jumps is solved in the following way:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>The jump instruction is written with a (temporary) relative offset equal to 0.</li>
    <li>
        The target Label object is updated to memorize the fact that this jump instruction makes a forward reference to this label
        (the <code>forwardReferences</code> array in <code>Label</code> is used for that).
    </li>
    <li>
        When this label is visited, i.e. when its bytecode offset becomes known,
        all the forward jump instructions to this label (given by <code>forwardReferences</code>) are updated,
        to replace the temporary relative offsets with their real values, which can now be computed.
    </li>
</ul>
