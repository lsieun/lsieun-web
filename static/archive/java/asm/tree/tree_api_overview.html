<h2>Tree API VS Core API</h2>

<p class="indented">
    Using <span class="text-compare-green">the tree API</span> to <span class="text-compare-grey">generate a class</span>
    <span class="text-key-point">takes about 30% more time and consumes more memory</span>
    than using <span class="text-compare-green">the core API</span>.
    But it makes it possible to generate the class elements in any order, which can be convenient in some cases.

<div class="w3-panel w3-pale-blue w3-leftbar w3-border-blue">

        class generation是从“无”到“有”生成一个.class文件。

    <span class="text-compare-grey">Adding and removing class members</span> simply consists in adding or removing
    elements in the <code>fields</code> or <code>methods</code> lists of a <code>ClassNode</code> object.

<p class="indented">
    Like for <span class="text-compare-grey">class generation</span>,
    using <span class="text-compare-green">the tree API</span> to <span class="text-compare-grey">transform classes</span>
    <span class="text-key-point">takes more time and consumes more memory</span>
    than using <span class="text-compare-green">the core API</span>.
    But it makes it possible to implement some transformations more easily.
    This is the case, for example, of <span class="text-example">a transformation that adds to a class an annotation containing a digital signature of its content</span>.
    With <span class="text-compare-green">the core API</span> the digital signature can be computed only when all the class has been visited,
    but then it is too late to add an annotation containing it,
    because annotations must be visited before class members.
    With <span class="text-compare-green">the tree API</span> this problem disappears because there is no such constraint in this case.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    In fact it is possible to implement the <code>AddDigitalSignature</code> example with <span class="text-compare-green">the core API</span>,
    but then the class must be transformed in two passes.
    During <span class="text-compare-grey">the first pass</span> the class is visited with a <code>ClassReader</code> (and no <code>ClassWriter</code>),
    in order to compute the digital signature based on the class content.
    During <span class="text-compare-grey">the second pass</span> the same <code>ClassReader</code> is reused to do a second visit of the class,
    this time with an <code>AddAnnotationAdapter</code> chained to a <code>ClassWriter</code>.
    By generalizing this argument we see that, in fact,
    <span class="text-key-point">any transformation can be implemented with the core API alone, by using several passes if necessary.</span>
    But this increases the transformation code complexity,
    this requires to store state between passes (which can be as complex as a full tree representation!),
    and parsing the class several times has a cost,
    which must be compared to the cost of constructing the corresponding <code>ClassNode</code>.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    The conclusion is that <span class="text-emphasize"><span class="text-compare-green">the tree API</span> is generally
    used for transformations that cannot be implemented in one pass with <span class="text-compare-green">the core API</span></span>.
    But there are of course exceptions.
    For example <span class="text-example">an obfuscator cannot be implemented in one pass</span>,
    because you cannot transform classes before the mapping from original to obfuscated names is fully constructed,
    which requires to parse all classes.
    But <span class="text-compare-green">the tree API</span> is not a good solution either,
    because it would require keeping in memory the object representation of all the classes to obfuscate.
    In this case it is better to use <span class="text-compare-green">the core API</span> with two passes:
    <span class="text-compare-grey">one to compute the mapping between original and obfuscated names</span>
    (a simple hash table that requires much less memory than a full object representation of all the classes),
    and <span class="text-compare-grey">one to transform the classes based on this mapping</span>.
