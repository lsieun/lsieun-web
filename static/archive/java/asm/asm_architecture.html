<p>
    ASM applications have a strong architectural aspect.
    Indeed the <span class="text-example">event based API</span> is organized around
    <span class="text-key-point">event producers</span> (the <span class="text-emphasize">class parser</span>),
    <span class="text-key-point">event consumers</span> (the <span class="text-emphasize">class writer</span>) and
    <span class="text-key-point">various predefined event filters</span>,
    to which user defined producers, consumers and filters can be added.
</p>

<p>
    Using this API is therefore a <span class="text-key-point">two step process</span>:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        assembling event producer, filter and consumer components into possibly complex architectures,
    </li>
    <li>
        and then starting the event producers to run the generation or transformation process.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    The <span class="text-example">object based API</span> also has an architectural aspect:
    indeed <span class="text-key-point">class generator or transformer components</span> that operate on object trees can be composed,
    <span class="text-key-point">the links between them</span> representing the order of transformations.

    这里还有不一部分内容，我暂时不明白，因此没有记录下来
