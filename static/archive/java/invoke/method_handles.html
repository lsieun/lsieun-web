<h2>Method handles</h2>

<p class="indented">
    <b>Method handles</b> are often described as a retrofitted version of <b>Java's reflection API</b>, but this is not what they are meant to represent.
    While method handles can represent a method, constructor or field, they are not intended to describe properties of these class members.
    It is for example not possible to directly extract metadata from a method handle such as modifiers or annotation values of the represented method.
    And while method handles allow for the invocation of a referenced method, their main purpose is to be used together with an <code>invokedynamic</code> call site.
    For gaining a better understanding of <b>method handles</b>, looking at them as <b>an imperfect replacement for the reflection API</b> is however a reasonable starting point.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Method handles cannot be instantiated.
    Instead, method handles are created by using a designated lookup object.
    These objects are themselves created by using a factory method that is provided by the <code>MethodHandles</code> class.
    Whenever this factory is invoked, it first creates a security context which ensures that the resulting lookup object can only locate methods that are also visible to the class from which the factory method was invoked.
    A lookup object can then be created as follows:
</p>

<div title="Example.java" class="javacode">
class Example {
    void doSomething() {
        MethodHandles.Lookup lookup = MethodHandles.lookup();
    }
    private void foo() { /* ... */ }
}
</div>

<p class="indented">
    As argued before, the above lookup object could only be used to locate methods that are also visible to the <code>Example</code> class such as <code>foo</code>.
    It would for example be impossible to look up a private method of another class.
    This is <b>a first major difference</b> to using the reflection API where private methods of outside classes can be located just as any other method and where these methods can even be invoked after marking such a method as accessible.
    Method handles are therefore sensible of their creation context which is a first major difference to the reflection API.

    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Apart from that, a method handle is more specific than the reflection API by describing a specific type of method rather than representing just any method.
    In a Java program, <b>a method's type</b> is a composite of both <b>the method's return type</b> and <b>the types of its parameters</b>.
    For example, the only method of the following <code>Counter</code> class returns an <code>int</code> representing the number of characters of the only <code>String</code>-typed argument:
    <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：method type = return type + parameter types</sub>
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<div title="HelloWorld.java" class="javacode">
class Counter {
    static int count(String name) {
        return name.length();
    }
}
</div>

<p class="indented">
    A representation of this method's type can be created by using another factory.
    This factory is found in the <code>MethodType</code> class which also represents instances of created method types.
    Using this factory, the method type for <code>Counter::count</code> can be created
    by handing over <b>the method's return type</b> and its <b>parameter types</b> bundled as an array:
</p>

<div title="MethodType examples" class="javacode">
MethodType methodType = MethodType.methodType(int.class, new Class&lt;?&gt;[] {String.class});
</div>

<p class="indented">
    By using the lookup object that was created before and the above method type,
    it is now possible to locate a method handle that represents the <code>Counter::count</code> method as depicted in the following code:
</p>

<div title="Counter::count example" class="javacode">
MethodType methodType = MethodType.methodType(int.class, new Class<?>[] {String.class});
MethodHandles.Lookup lookup = MethodHandles.lookup();
MethodHandle methodHandle = lookup.findStatic(Counter.class, "count", methodType);
int count = (int)methodHandle.invokeExact("foo");
assertThat(count, is(3));
</div>

<p class="indented">
    <b>
        At first glance, using a method handle might seem like an overly complex version of using the reflection API.
        However, keep in mind that the direct invocation of a method using a handle is not the main intent of its use.
    </b>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    The main difference of the above example code and of invoking a method via the reflection API is only revealed
    when looking into the differences of how the Java compiler translates both invocations into Java byte code.
    When a Java program invokes a method, this method is uniquely identified by its name and by its (non-generic) parameter types and even by its return type.
    It is for this reason that it is possible to overload methods in Java.
    And even though the Java programming language does not allow it, the JVM does in theory allow to overload a method by its return type.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Following this principle, a reflective method call is executed as a common method call of the <code>Method::invoke</code> method.
    This method is identified by its two parameters which are of the types <code>Object</code> and <code>Object[]</code>.
    In addition to this, the method is identified by its <code>Object</code> return type.
    Because of this signature, all arguments to this method need to always be boxed and enclosed in an array.
    Similarly, the return value needs to be boxed if it was primitive or <code>null</code> is returned if the method was <code>void</code>.
</p>

<div title="Method::invoke" class="javacode">
public Object invoke(Object obj, Object... args) {
    // ......
}
</div>

<p class="indented">
    Method handles are the exception to this rule.
    Instead of invoking a method handle by referring to the signature of <code>MethodHandle::invokeExact</code> signature
    which takes an <code>Object[]</code> as its single argument and returns <code>Object</code>,
    method handles are invoked by using a so-called polymorphic signature.
    A polymorphic signature is created by the Java compiler dependant on the types of the actual arguments and the expected return type at a call site.
</p>

<div title="MethodHandle::invokeExact" class="javacode">
public final native Object invokeExact(Object... args) throws Throwable;
</div>

<p>
    For example, when invoking the method handle as above with
</p>

<div title="HelloWorld.java" class="javacode">
int count = (int)methodHandle.invokeExact("foo");
</div>

<div title="MethodHandle.invokeExact:(Ljava/lang/String;)I" class="plaintext">
0033: invokevirtual   #12  // B6000C     || java/lang/invoke/MethodHandle.invokeExact:(Ljava/lang/String;)I
0036: istore          4    // 3604
</div>

<p class="indented">
    the Java compiler translates this invocation as if the <code>invokeExact</code> method was defined to
    accept a single argument of type <code>String</code> and returning an <code>int</code> type.
    Obviously, such a method does not exist and for (almost) any other method, this would result in a linkage error at runtime.
    For method handles, the Java Virtual Machine does however recognize this signature to be polymorphic and
    treats the invocation of the method handle as if the <code>Counter::count</code> method that the handle refers to was inset directly into the call site.
    Thus, the method can be invoked without the overhead of boxing primitive values or the return type and without placing the argument values inside an array.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    At the same time, when using the <code>invokeExact</code> invocation,
    it is guaranteed to the Java virtual machine that the method handle always references a method at runtime that is compatible to the polymorphic signature.
    For the example, the JVM expected that the referenced method actually accepts a <code>String</code> as its only argument and that it returns a primitive <code>int</code>.
    If this constraint was not fulfilled, the execution would instead result in a runtime error.
    However, any other method that accepts a single <code>String</code> and that returns a primitive <code>int</code> could be
    successfully filled into the method handle's call site to replace <code>Counter::count</code>.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    In contrast, using the <code>Counter::count</code> method handle at the following three invocations would result in runtime errors, even though the code compiles successfully:
</p>

<div title="HelloWorld.java" class="javacode">
int count1 = methodHandle.invokeExact((Object) "foo");
int count2 = (Integer) methodHandle.invokeExact("foo");
methodHandle.invokeExact("foo");
</div>

<p class="indented">
    The first statement results in an error because the argument that is handed to the handle is too general.
    While the JVM expected a <code>String</code> as an argument to the method, the Java compiler suggested that the argument would be an <code>Object</code> type.
    It is important to understand that the Java compiler took the casting as a hint for
    creating a different polymorphic signature with an <code>Object</code> type as a single parameter type
    while the JVM expected a <code>String</code> at runtime.
    Note that this restriction also holds for handing too specific arguments,
    for example when casting an argument to an <code>Integer</code> where the method handle required a <code>Number</code> type as its argument.
    In the second statement, the Java compiler suggested to the runtime that
    the handle's method would return an <code>Integer</code> wrapper type instead of the primitive <code>int</code>.
    And without suggesting a return type at all in the third statement,
    the Java compiler implicitly translated the invocation into a <code>void</code> method call.
    Hence, <code>invokeExact</code> really does mean exact.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    This restriction can sometimes be too harsh.
    For this reason, instead of requiring an exact invocation, the method handle also allows for a more forgiving invocation
    where conversions such as type castings and boxings are applied.
    This sort of invocation can be applied by using the <code>MethodHandle::invoke</code> method.
    Using this method, the Java compiler still creates a polymorphic signature.
    This time, the Java virtual machine does however test the actual arguments and the return type
    for compatibility at run time and converts them by applying boxings or castings, if appropriate.
    Obviously, these transformations can sometimes add a runtime overhead.
</p>

<h2>Fields, methods and constructors: handles as a unified interface</h2>

<p class="indented">
    Other than <code>Method</code> instances of the reflection API, method handles can equally reference fields or constructors.
    The name of the <code>MethodHandle</code> type could therefore be seen as too narrow.
    Effectively, it does not matter what class member is referenced via a method handle at runtime
    as long as its <code>MethodType</code>, another type with a misleading name, matches the arguments that are passed at the associated call site.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Using the appropriate factories of a <code>MethodHandles.Lookup</code> object, a field can be looked up to represent a getter or a setter.
    Using getters or setters in this context does not refer to invoking an actual method that follows the Java bean specification.
    Instead, the field-based method handle directly reads from or writes to the field but in shape of a method call via invoking the method handle.
    By representing such field access via method handles, field access or method invocations can be used interchangeably.
</p>

<p>
    As an example for such interchange, take the following class:
</p>

<div title="Bean.java" class="javacode">
class Bean {
    String value;
    void print(String x) {
        System.out.println(x);
    }
}
</div>

<p class="indented">
    For the above <code>Bean</code> class, the following method handles can be used for either writing a string to the <code>value</code> field or for invoking the <code>print</code> method with the same string as an argument:
</p>

<div title="examples" class="javacode">
MethodHandle fieldHandle = lookup.findSetter(Bean.class, "value", String.class);
MethodType methodType = MethodType.methodType(void.class, new Class<?>[] {String.class});
MethodHandle methodHandle = lookup.findVirtual(Bean.class, "print", methodType);
</div>

<p class="indented">
    As long as the method handle call site is handed an instance of <code>Bean</code> together with a <code>String</code>
    while returning <code>void</code>, both method handles could be used interchangeably as shown here:
</p>

<div title="examples" class="javacode">
anyHandle.invokeExact((Bean) mybean, (String) myString);
</div>

<p class="indented">
    Note that the polymorphic signature of the above call site does <b>not</b> match the method type of the above handle.
    However, within Java byte code, non-static methods are invoked as if they were static methods with where the <code>this</code> reference is handed as a first, implicit argument.
    A non-static method's nominal type does therefore diverge from its actual runtime type.
    Similarly, access to a non-static field requires an instance to be access.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Similarly to fields and methods, it is possible to locate and invoke <b>constructors</b>
    which are considered as methods with a <code>void</code> return value for their nominal type.
    Furthermore, one can not only invoke a method directly but even invoke a super method
    as long as this <code>super</code> method is reachable for the class from which the lookup factory was created.
    In contrast, invoking a super method is not possible at all
    when relying on the reflection API.
    If required, it is even possible to return a constant value from a handle.
</p>

<h2>Performance metrics</h2>

<p class="indented">
    <b>Method handles are often described as being a more performant as the Java reflection API</b>.
    At least for recent releases of the HotSpot virtual machine, this is not true.
    The simplest way of proving this is <a class="external" href="https://gist.github.com/raphw/881e1745996f9d314ab0" target="_blank">writing an appropriate benchmark</a>.
    Then again, is not all too simple to write a benchmark for a Java program which is optimized while it is executed.
    The de facto standard for writing a benchmark has become using <a class="external" href="https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/" target="_blank">JMH</a>, a harness that ships under the OpenJDK umbrella.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    From the benchmark, it becomes obvious that reflection is already implemented quite efficiently.
    Modern JVMs know a concept named inflation where a frequently invoked reflective method call is replaced with runtime generated Java byte code.
    What remains is the overhead of applying the boxing for passing arguments and receiving a return values.
    These boxings can sometimes be eliminated by the JVM's Just-in-time compiler but this is not always possible.
    For this reason, using method handles can be more performant than using the reflection API if method calls involve a significant amount of primitive values.
    This does however require that the exact method signatures are already known at compile time such that the appropriate polymorphic signature can be created.
    For most use cases of the reflection API, this guarantee can however not be given because the invoked method's types are not known at compile time.
    In this case, using method handles does not offer any performance benefits and should not be used to replace it.
</p>

<h2>Creating an invokedynamic call site</h2>

<p class="indented">
    Normally, <code>invokedynamic</code> call sites are created by the Java compiler only when it needs to translate <b>a lambda expression</b> into <b>byte code</b>.
    It is worthwhile to note that lambda expressions could have been implemented without <code>invokedynamic</code> call sites altogether, for example by converting them into anonymous inner classes.
    As a main difference to the suggested approach, using <code>invokedynamic</code> delays the creation of a similar class to runtime.
    We are looking into class creation in the next section.
    For now, bear however in mind that <code>invokedynamic</code> does not have anything to do with class creation,
    it only allows to delay the decision of how to dispatch a method until runtime.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    For a better understanding of <code>invokedynamic</code> call sites, it helps to create such call sites explicitly in order to look at the mechanic in isolation.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Any <code>invokedynamic</code> call site eventually yields a <code>MethodHandle</code> that references the method to be invoked.
    Instead of invoking this method handle manually, it is however up to the Java runtime to do so.
    Because method handles have become a known concept to the Java virtual machine, these invocations are then optimized similarly to a common method call.
    Any such method handle is received from a so-called bootstrap method which is nothing more than a plain Java method that fulfills a specific signature.
    For a trivial example of a bootstrap method, look at the following code:
</p>

<div title="HelloWorld.java" class="javacode">
class Bootstrapper {
    public static CallSite bootstrap(Object... args) throws Throwable {
        MethodType methodType = MethodType.methodType(int.class, new Class&lt;?&gt;[] {String.class});
        MethodHandles.Lookup lookup = MethodHandles.lookup();
        MethodHandle methodHandle = lookup.findStatic(Counter.class, "count", methodType);
        return new ConstantCallSite(methodHandle);
    }
}
</div>

<p class="indented">
    For now, we do not care much about the arguments(<code>Object... args</code>) of the <code>bootstrap</code> method.
    Instead, notice that the <code>bootstrap</code> method is <code>static</code> which is as a matter of fact a requirement.
    Within Java byte code, an <code>invokedynamic</code> call site references the full signature of a <code>bootstrap</code> method
    but not a specific object which could have a state and a life cycle.
    Once the <code>invokedynamic</code> call site is invoked, control flow is handed to the referenced bootstrap method
    which is now responsible for identifying a method handle.
    Once this method handle is returned from the bootstrap method, it is invoked by the Java runtime.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    As obvious from the above example, a <code>MethodHandle</code> is not returned directly from a bootstrap method.
    Instead, the handle is wrapped inside of a <code>CallSite</code> object.
    Whenever a bootstrap method is invoked, the <code>invokedynamic</code> call site is later permanently bound to the <code>CallSite</code> object that is returned from this method.
    Consequently, a bootstrap method is only invoked a single time for any call site.
    Thanks to this intermediate <code>CallSite</code> object, it is however possible to exchange the referenced <code>MethodHandle</code> at a later point.
    For this purpose, the Java class library already offers different implementations of <code>CallSite</code>.
    We have already seen a <code>ConstantCallSite</code> in the example code above.
    As the name suggests, a <code>ConstantCallSite</code> always references the same method handle without a possibility of a later exchange.
    Alternatively, it is however also possible to for example use a <code>MutableCallSite</code>
    which allows to change the referenced <code>MethodHandle</code> at a later point in time or it is even possible to implement a custom <code>CallSite</code> class.
</p>
