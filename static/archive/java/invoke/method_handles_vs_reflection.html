<p class="indented">
    Method handles were introduced in order to work alongside the existing <code>java.lang.reflect</code> API,
    as they serve different purposes and have different characteristics.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    From a performance standpoint,
    <b>the MethodHandles API can be much faster than the Reflection API</b> since the access checks are made at creation time rather than at execution time.
    This difference gets amplified if a security manager is present, since member and class lookups are subject to additional checks.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    However, considering that performance isn't the only suitability measure for a task,
    we have also to consider that the MethodHandles API is harder to use due to the lack of mechanisms such as member class enumeration, accessibility flags inspection and more.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Even so, the MethodHandles API offers the possibility to curry methods, change the types of parameters and change their order.
