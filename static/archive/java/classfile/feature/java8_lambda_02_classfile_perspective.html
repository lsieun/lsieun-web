<h2>Lambda expressions</h2>

<p class="indented">
    Whenever the Java compiler translates <b>a lambda expression</b> into <b>byte code</b>,
    it copies <b>the lambda's body</b> into <b>a private method</b> inside of the class in which the expression is defined.
    These methods are named <code>lambda$X$Y</code> with <code>X</code> being the name of the method that contains the lambda expression
    and with <code>Y</code> being a zero-based sequence number.
    <b>The parameters of such a method</b> are those of the functional interface that the lambda expression implements.
    Given that the lambda expression makes no use of non-static fields or methods of the enclosing class,
    the method is also defined to be <code>static</code>(<code>ACC_STATIC</code>).
</p>

<div title="HelloWorld.java" class="javacode">
import java.util.function.Function;

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Function&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; func = item -> item + 5;
    }
}
</div>

<p>
    注意，在<code>HelloWorld.class</code>文件中，生成了一个<code>lambda$main$0</code>方法，这个方法的名字符合<code>lambda$X$Y</code>的格式规则。

<p class="indented">
    For compensation, <b>the lambda expression</b> is itself substituted by an <code>invokedynamic</code> call site.
    On its invocation, this call site requests the binding of a factory for an instance of the functional interface.
    As arguments to this factory, the call site supplies any values of the lambda expression's enclosing method
    which are used inside of the expression and a reference to the enclosing instance, if required.
    As a return type, the factory is required to provide an instance of the functional interface.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    For bootstrapping a call site, any <code>invokedynamic</code> instruction currently delegates to the <code>LambdaMetafactory</code> class
    which is included in the Java class library.
    This factory is then responsible for creating a class that implements the functional interface
    and which invokes the appropriate method that contains the lambda's body which, as described before, is stored in the original class.
    In the future, this bootstrapping process might however change which is one of the major advantages of using <code>invokedynamic</code> for implementing lambda expressions.
    If one day, a better suited language feature was available for implementing lambda expressions, the current implementation could simply be swapped out.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    In order to being able to create a class that implements the functional interface, any call site representing a lambda expression provides additional arguments to the bootstrap method.
    For the obligatory arguments, it already provides <b>the name of the functional interface's method</b>.
    Also, it provides a <code>MethodType</code> of the factory method that the bootstrapping is supposed to yield as a result.
    Additionally, the bootstrap method is supplied another <code>MethodType</code> that describes the signature of the functional interface's method.
    To that, it receives a <code>MethodHandle</code> referencing the method that contains the lambda's method body.
    Finally, the call site provides a <code>MethodType</code> of the generic signature of the functional interface's method, i.e. the signature of the method at the call site before type-erasure was applied.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    When invoked, the bootstrap method looks at these arguments and creates an appropriate implementation of a class that implements the functional interface.
    This class is created using the ASM library, a low-level byte code parser and writer that has become the de facto standard for direct Java byte code manipulation.
    Besides implementing the functional interface's method, the bootstrap method also adds an appropriate constructor and a static factory method for creating instances of the class.
    It is this factory method that is later bound to the <code>invokedyanmic</code> call site.
    As arguments, the factory receives an instance to the lambda method's enclosing instance, in case it is accessed and also any values that are read from the enclosing method.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    You might have noticed that the lambda expression's method body is contained in a private method which is now invoked from another class.
    Normally, this would result in an illegal access error.
    To overcome this limitation, the generated classes are loaded using so-called anonymous class loading.
    Anonymous class loading can only be applied when a class is loaded explicitly by handing a byte array.
    Also, it is not normally possible to apply anonymous class loading in user code as it is hidden away in the internal classes of the Java class library.
    When a class is loaded using anonymous class loading, it receives a host class of which it inherits its full security context.
    This involves both method and field access rights and the protection domain such that a lambda expression can also be generated for signed jar files.
    Using this approch, lambda expression can be considered more secure than anonymous inner classes because private methods are never reachable from outside of a class.
