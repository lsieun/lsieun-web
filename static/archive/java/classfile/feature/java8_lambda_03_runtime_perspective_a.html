<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p class="indented">
    Invoke Dynamic (Also known as Indy) was part of <a class="external" href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=292" target="_blank">JSR 292</a> intended to enhance the JVM support for dynamically typed languages.
    After its first release in Java 7, the <code>invokedynamic</code> opcode is used quite extensively by dynamic JVM-based languages like JRuby and even statically typed languages like Java.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Before Java 7, the JVM only had four method invocation types:
    <code>invokevirtual</code> to call normal class methods,
    <code>invokestatic</code> to call static methods,
    <code>invokeinterface</code> to call interface methods,
    and <code>invokespecial</code> to call constructors or private methods.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    <b>
        Despite their differences, all these invocations share one simple trait:
        They have a few predefined steps to complete each method call, and we can't enrich these steps with our custom behaviors.
    </b>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    There are two main workarounds for this limitation: One at compile-time and the other at runtime.
    The former is usually used by languages like Scala or Koltin and the latter is the solution of choice for JVM-based dynamic languages like JRuby.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    The runtime approach is usually reflection-based and consequently, inefficient.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    On the other hand, the compile-time solution is usually relying on code-generation at compile-time.
    This approach is more efficient at runtime.
    However, it's somewhat brittle and also may cause a slower startup time as there's more bytecode to process.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Now that we've got a better understanding of the problem, let's see how the solution works internally.
</p>

<h2>Under the Hood</h2>

<p class="indented">
    When the JVM sees an <code>invokedynamic</code> opcode for the first time, it calls a special method known as the <b>bootstrap method</b> to initialize the invocation process:
</p>

<div class="w3-display-container w3-center">
    <img class="w3-image w3-center" src="/images/java/classfile/invokedynamic_bootstrap_method.svg" alt="Rotation"/>
</div>

<p>
    The <b>bootstrap method</b> is a normal piece of Java code that we've written to set up the invocation process. Therefore, it can contain any logic.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Once the bootstrap method completes normally, it should return an instance of <code>CallSite</code>.
    This <code>CallSite</code> encapsulates the following pieces of information:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>A pointer to the actual logic that JVM should execute. This should be represented as a <code>MethodHandle</code>.</li>
    <li>A condition representing the validity of the returned <code>CallSite</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="indented">
    From now on, every time JVM sees this particular opcode again, it will skip <b>the slow path</b> and directly calls the underlying executable.
    Moreover, the JVM will continue to skip <b>the slow path</b> until the condition in the <code>CallSite</code> changes.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    As opposed to the Reflection API, the JVM can completely see-through <code>MethodHandles</code> and will try to optimize them, hence the better performance.
</p>

<h3>Different Types of CallSites</h3>

<p class="indented">
    Once the JVM sees <code>invokedynamic</code> for the first time, it calls <b>the bootstrap method</b>.
    As of writing this article, <b>the lambda bootstrap method will use the <code>InnerClassLambdaMetafactory</code> to generate an inner class for the lambda at runtime</b>.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Then the bootstrap method encapsulates the generated inner class inside a special type of <code>CallSite</code> known as <code>ConstantCallSite</code>.
    This type of <code>CallSite</code> would never change after setup.
    Therefore, after the first setup for each lambda, the JVM will always use the fast path to directly call the lambda logic.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Although this is the most efficient type of <code>invokedynamic</code>, it's certainly not the only available option.
    As a matter of fact, Java provides <code>MutableCallSite</code> and <code>VolatileCallSite</code> to accommodate for more dynamic requirements.
</p>

<h3>Advantages</h3>

<p class="indented">
    So, in order to implement <b>lambda expressions</b>, instead of creating <b>anonymous inner classes</b> at <b>compile-time</b>, Java creates them at <b>runtime</b> via <code>invokedynamic</code>.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    One might argue against deferring inner class generation until runtime.
    However, the <code>invokedynamic</code> approach has a few advantages over the simple compile-time solution.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    First, the JVM does not generate the inner class until the first use of lambda.
    Hence, <b>we won't pay for the extra footprint associated with the inner class before the first lambda execution.</b>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Additionally, much of the linkage logic is moved out from the bytecode to the bootstrap method.
    Therefore, <b>the <code>invokedynamic</code> bytecode is usually much smaller than alternative solutions.</b>
    The smaller bytecode can boost startup speed.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Suppose a newer version of Java comes with a more efficient bootstrap method implementation.
    <b>Then our <code>invokedynamic</code> bytecode can take advantage of this improvement without recompiling.</b>
    This way we can achieve some sort of forwarding binary compatibility.
    Basically, we can switch between different strategies without recompilation.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Finally, writing the bootstrap and linkage logic in Java is usually easier than traversing an AST to generate a complex piece of bytecode.
    So, <code>invokedynamic</code> can be (subjectively) less brittle.
</p>
