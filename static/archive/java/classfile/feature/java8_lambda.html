<p class="indented">
    We know that Java code itself does not compile directly to bytes that are executed by the operating system.
    Instead, the Java compiler (henceforth, “javac”) compiles to another intermediate form, which is executed by the Java Virtual Machine (henceforth, “JVM”).
    This intermediate form is called the <b>Java bytecode</b>.
    <b>Bytecode, however, has no concept of lambdas.</b>
    It also has no concept of try-with-resources blocks, enhanced for-loops, or many of the other structures within Java.
    Instead, the compiler converts those Java structures into an underlying form in bytecode.

<h2>Method References in Bytecode</h2>

<p>
    In terms of bytecode, the simplest kind of lambda is the <b>method reference</b>.
