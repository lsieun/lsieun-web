<p class="indented">
    The ultimate goal of constant pool resolution is to replace a <b>symbolic reference</b> with a <b>direct reference</b>.
    The form of symbolic references is well-defined in JVM Specification, but what form do direct references take?
    As you might expect, the form of direct references is yet another decision of the designers of individual Java Virtual Machine implementations.
    Nevertheless, there are some characteristics likely to be common among most implementations.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    <b>Direct references to types, class variables, and class methods</b> are likely native pointers into the method area.
    <b>A direct reference to a type</b> can simply point to the implementation-specific data structure in the method area that holds the type data.
    <b>A direct reference to a class variable</b> can point to the class variable's value stored in the method area.
    <b>A direct reference to a class method</b> can point to a data structure in the method area that contains the data needed to invoke the method.
    For example, the data structure for a <b>class method</b> could include information such as whether or not the method is native.
    If the method is native, the data structure could include a function pointer to the dynamically linked native method implementation.
    If the method is not native, the data structure could include the method's bytecodes, max_stack, max_locals, and so on.
    If there is a just-in-time-compiled version of the method, the data structure could include a pointer to that just-in-time-compiled native code.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    <b>Direct references to instance variables and instance methods</b> are offsets.
    <b>A direct reference to an instance variable</b> is likely the offset from the start of the object's image to the location of the instance variable.
    <b>A direct reference to an instance method</b> is likely an offset into a method table.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Using <code>offset</code> to represent <b>direct references</b> to <b>instance variables</b> and <b>instance methods</b> depends on a predictable ordering of the <b>fields</b> in a class's object image and the <b>methods</b> in a class's <b>method table</b>.
    Although implementation designers may choose any way of placing instance variables into an object
    image or methods into a method table, they will almost certainly use the same way for all types.
    Therefore, in any one implementation, the ordering of fields in an object and methods in a method table
    is defined and predictable.
</p>

<p>
    As an example, consider this hierarchy of three classes and one interface:
</p>

<div title="Friendly.java" class="javacode">
public interface Friendly {
    void sayHello();

    void sayGoodbye();
}
</div>

<div title="Dog.java" class="javacode">
public class Dog {
    // How many times this dog wags its tail when saying hello.
    private int wagCount = ((int) (Math.random() * 5.0)) + 1;

    public void sayHello() {
        System.out.print("Wag");
        for (int i = 0; i < wagCount; ++i) {
            System.out.print(", wag");
        }
        System.out.println(".");
    }

    public String toString() {
        return "Woof!";
    }
}
</div>

<div title="CockerSpaniel.java" class="javacode">
public class CockerSpaniel extends Dog implements Friendly {
    // How many times this Cocker Spaniel woofs when saying hello.
    private int woofCount = ((int) (Math.random() * 4.0)) + 1;

    // How many times this Cocker Spaniel wimpers when saying goodbye.
    private int wimperCount = ((int) (Math.random() * 3.0)) + 1;

    public void sayHello() {
        // Wag that tail a few times.
        super.sayHello();

        System.out.print("Woof");
        for (int i = 0; i < woofCount; ++i) {
            System.out.print(", woof");
        }
        System.out.println("!");
    }

    public void sayGoodbye() {
        System.out.print("Wimper");
        for (int i = 0; i < wimperCount; ++i) {
            System.out.print(", wimper");
        }
        System.out.println(".");
    }
}
</div>

<div title="Cat.java" class="javacode">
public class Cat implements Friendly {
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Chomp, chomp, chomp.");
    }

    public void sayHello() {
        System.out.println("Rub, rub, rub.");
    }

    public void sayGoodbye() {
        System.out.println("Scamper.");
    }

    protected void finalize() {
        System.out.println("Meow!");
    }
}
</div>

<h2>instance variables</h2>

<p class="indented">
    Assume these types are loaded into a Java Virtual Machine that organizes objects
    by placing the <b>instance variables</b> declared in <b>superclasses</b> into the object image before those declared in <b>subclasses</b>,
    <sub class="my_note" style="color:green">笔记：这里讲superclass和subclass之间field存储的顺序关系</sub>
    and by placing the <b>instance variables</b> for each individual class in their order of appearance in the class file.
    <sub class="my_note" style="color:green">笔记：这里讲同一个class内部的field存储的顺序关系</sub>
    Assuming there are no instance variables in class <code>Object</code>, the object images for <code>Dog</code>, <code>CockerSpaniel</code>, and <code>Cat</code> would appear as shown in the following Picture.
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<div class="w3-display-container w3-center">
    <img class="w3-image w3-center" src="/images/java/classfile/some_object_images.png" alt="some_object_images.png"/>
</div>

<p class="indented">
    In this figure, the object image for <code>CockerSpaniel</code> best illustrates this particular virtual machine's approach to laying out objects.
    The instance variable for <code>Dog</code>, the superclass, appears before the instance variables for <code>CockerSpaniel</code>, the subclass.
    The instance variables of <code>CockerSpaniel</code> appear in order of declaration: <code>woofCount</code> first, then <code>wimperCount</code>.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Note that the <code>wagCount</code> instance variable appears at offset one in both <code>Dog</code> and <code>CockerSpaniel</code>.
    In this implementation of the Java Virtual Machine, a symbolic reference to the <code>wagCount</code> field of class <code>Dog</code> would be resolved to direct reference that is an offset of one.
    Regardless of whether the actual object being referred to was a <code>Dog</code>, a <code>CockerSpaniel</code>, or any other subclass of <code>Dog</code>, the <code>wagCount</code> instance variable would always appear at offset one in the object image.
</p>

<h2>method tables</h2>

<p class="indented">
    A similar pattern emerges in <b>method tables</b>.
    A method table entry is associated in some way with data structures in the method area that contain sufficient data to enable the virtual machine to invoke the method.
    Assume that in the Java Virtual Machine implementation being described here, <b>method tables</b> are <b>arrays of native pointers into the method area</b>.
    The data structures that the method table entries point to are similar to the data structures described above for class methods.
    Assume that the particular Java Virtual Machine implementation that loads these types organizes its method tables
    by placing methods for superclasses into the method table before those for subclasses,
    <sub class="my_note" style="color:green">笔记：这里讲在method table中，superclass的method要放置在subclass的method的前面。</sub>
    and by placing pointers for each class in the order the methods appear in the class file.
    <sub class="my_note" style="color:green">笔记：这里讲在method table中，同一个class内部，method是按出现的顺序排列。</sub>
    The exception to the ordering is that methods that methods overridden by a subclass appear in the slot where the overridden method first appears in a superclass.
    <sub class="my_note" style="color:green">笔记：这里讲了一种例外的情况，这是subclass覆盖superclass的方法。</sub>
    <img src="/images/note.png" onclick="toggle_paragraph_sub_note(this)"/>
</p>

<p class="indented">
    The way this virtual machine would organize the <b>method table</b> for class <code>Dog</code> is shown in the following figure.
    In this figure, the method table entries that point to methods defined in class <code>Object</code> are shown in dark gray.
    Entries that point to methods defined in <code>Dog</code> are shown in light gray.
</p>

<div class="w3-display-container w3-center">
    <img class="w3-image w3-center" src="/images/java/classfile/the_method_table_for_class_dog.png" alt="the_method_table_for_class_dog.png"/>
</div>

<p class="indented">
    Note that <b>only non-private instance methods</b> appear in this <b>method table</b>.
    <b>Class methods</b>, which are invoked via the <code>invokestatic</code> instruction, need not appear here,
    because they are statically bound and don't need the extra indirection of a method table.
    <b>Private methods</b> and <b>instance initialization methods</b> need not appear
    here because they are invoked via the <code>invokespecial</code> instruction and are therefore statically bound.
    Only methods that are invoked with <code>invokevirtual</code> or <code>invokeinterface</code> appear in this method table.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    By looking at the source code, you can see that <code>Dog</code> overrides the <code>toString()</code> method defined in class <code>Object</code>.
    In <code>Dog</code>'s method table, the <code>toString()</code> method appears only once, in the same slot (offset seven) in which it appears in the method table for Object.
    The pointer residing at offset seven in <code>Dog</code>'s method table points to the data for <code>Dog</code>'s implementation of <code>toString()</code>.
    In this implementation of the Java Virtual Machine, the pointer to the method data for <code>toString()</code> will appear at offset seven for every method table of every class.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Below the methods declared in <code>Object</code>, which appear first in this method table, come the methods declared in <code>Dog</code> that don't override any method in <code>Object</code>.
    There is only one such method, <code>sayHello()</code>, which has the method table offset 11.
    All of <code>Dog</code>'s subclasses will either inherit or override this implementation of <code>sayHello()</code>,
    and some version of <code>sayHello()</code> will always appear at offset 11 of any subclass of <code>Dog</code>.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    The following figure shows the method table for <code>CockerSpaniel</code>.
    Note that because <code>CockerSpaniel</code> declares <code>sayHello()</code> and <code>sayGoodbye()</code>,
    the pointers for those methods point to the data for <code>CockerSpaniel</code>'s implementation of those methods.
    Because <code>CockerSpaniel</code> inherits <code>Dog</code>'s implementation of <code>toString()</code>,
    the pointer for that method (which is still at offset seven) points the data for <code>Dog</code>'s implementation of that method.
    <code>CockerSpaniel</code> inherits all other methods from Object, so the pointers for those methods point directly into <code>Object</code>'s type data.
    Note also that <code>sayHello()</code> is sitting at offset eleven, the same offset it has in <code>Dog</code>'s method table.
</p>

<div class="w3-display-container w3-center">
    <img class="w3-image w3-center" src="/images/java/classfile/the_method_table_for_class_cocker_spaniel.png" alt="the_method_table_for_class_cocker_spaniel.png"/>
</div>

<p class="indented">
    When the virtual machine resolves a <b>symbolic reference</b> (a <code>CONSTANT_Methodref_info</code> entry) to the <code>toString()</code> method of any class,
    the direct reference is method table offset seven.
    When the virtual machine resolves a <b>symbolic reference</b> to the <code>sayHello()</code> method of <code>Dog</code> or any of its subclasses,
    the <b>direct reference</b> is method table offset eleven.
    When the virtual machine resolves a <b>symbolic reference</b> to the <code>sayGoodbye()</code> method of <code>CockerSpaniel</code> or any of its subclasses,
    the <code>direct reference</code> is the method table offset twelve.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Once a <b>symbolic reference</b> to an <b>instance method</b> is resolved to a <code>method table</code> offset,
    the virtual machine must still actually invoke the method.
    To invoke an <b>instance method</b>, the virtual machine goes through <b>the object</b> to get at the <b>method table</b> for the object's class.
    Given a reference to an object, every virtual machine implementation must have some way to get at the type data for that object's class.
    In addition, given a reference to an object, the method table (a part of the type data for the object's class) is usually very quickly accessible.
    Once the virtual machine has the <b>method table</b> for the <b>object's class</b>, it uses the <code>offset</code> to find the actual method to invoke.
</p>

<h3>interface method</h3>

<p class="indented">
    The virtual machine can always depend on method table offsets when it has a reference of a class type (a <code>CONSTANT_Methodref_info</code> entry).
    If the <code>sayHello()</code> method appears in offset seven in class <code>Dog</code>, it will appear in offset seven in any subclass of <code>Dog</code>.
    The same is not true, however, if the reference is of an interface type (a <code>CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref_info</code> entry).
    With direct references to instance methods accessed through an interface reference there is no guaranteed method table offset.
    Consider the method table for class <code>Cat</code>, shown in the following figure.
</p>

<div class="w3-display-container w3-center">
    <img class="w3-image w3-center" src="/images/java/classfile/the_method_table_for_class_cat.png" alt="the_method_table_for_class_cat.png"/>
</div>

<p class="indented">
    Note that both <code>Cat</code> and <code>CockerSpaniel</code> implement the <code>Friendly</code> interface.
    A variable of type <code>Friendly</code> could hold a reference to a <code>Cat</code> object or a <code>CockerSpaniel</code> object.
    With that reference, your program could invoke <code>sayHello()</code> or <code>sayGoodbye()</code> on a <code>Cat</code>, a <code>CockerSpaniel</code>,
    or any other object whose class implements the <code>Friendly</code> interface.
</p>

<div title="HelloWorld.java" class="javacode">
public class HelloWorld {
    public void test() {
        CockerSpaniel cs = new CockerSpaniel();
        cs.sayHello();

        Dog dog = cs;
        dog.sayHello();

        Friendly fr = (Friendly) dog;
        // Invoke sayGoodbye() on a CockerSpaniel object through a reference of type Friendly.
        fr.sayGoodbye();

        fr = new Cat();
        // Invoke sayGoodbye() on a Cat object through a reference of type Friendly.
        fr.sayGoodbye();
    }
}

<p class="indented">
    Local variable <code>fr</code> invokes <code>sayGoodbye()</code> on both a <code>CockerSpaniel</code> object and a <code>Cat</code> object.
    The same constant pool entry, a <code>CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref_info</code> entry, is used to invoke this method on both objects.
    But when the virtual machine resolves the <b>symbolic reference</b> to <code>sayHello()</code>,
    it can't just save a method table offset and expect that offset to always work in future uses of the constant pool entry.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    The trouble is that classes that implement the <code>Friendly</code> interface aren't guaranteed to have a common superclass that also implements <code>Friendly</code>.
    As a result, the methods declared in <code>Friendly</code> aren't guaranteed to be in the same place in all method tables.
    If you compare the method table for <code>CockerSpaniel</code> against the method table for <code>Cat</code>, for example,
    you'll see that in <code>CockerSpaniel</code>, <code>sayHello()</code>'s pointer occupies offset 11.
    But in <code>Cat</code>, <code>sayHello()</code> occupies offset 12.
    Likewise, <code>CockerSpaniel</code>'s <code>sayGoodbye()</code> method pointer resides in offset 12,
    but <code>Cat</code>'s <code>sayGoodbye()</code> method pointer resides at offset 13.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Thus, whenever the Java Virtual Machine invokes a method from an <b>interface reference</b>,
    it must search the method table of the object's class until it finds the appropriate method.
    This is why invoking <b>instance methods on interface references</b> can be significantly slower than invoking <b>instance methods on class references</b>.
    Virtual machine implementations can attempt to be smart, of course, about how they search through a method table.
    For example, an implementation could save the last index at which they found the method and try there first the next time.
    Or an implementation could build data structures during preparation that help them search through method tables given an interface reference.
    Nevertheless, invoking a method given an interface reference will almost certainly be to some extent slower than invoking a method given a class reference.
