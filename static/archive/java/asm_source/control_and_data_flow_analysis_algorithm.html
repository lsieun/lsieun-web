    This article presents the algorithm used to compute <span class="text-compare-grey">the maximum stack size</span> and <span class="text-compare-grey">the stack map frames</span> of a method.
    This algorithm is a <span class="text-emphasize">control and data flow analysis algorithm</span>,
    based on the decomposition of the method into <span class="text-compare-green">a control flow graph of basic blocks</span>.

<p class="indented">
    A <span class="text-compare-green">basic block</span> is a sequence of instructions
    where only the first instruction is the target of a jump instruction,

<p class="indented">
    The <span class="text-compare-green">control flow graph of a method</span> is the graph

    Let's take a simple example in order to explain the details of this algorithm.
    Consider the following very simple method (where B is a subclass of A):
</p>

<div title="simple method" class="plaintext">
public static m(Z)LA;
  GETSTATIC B.VALUE : LB;
  ASTORE 1
  GOTO L0

  GETSTATIC A.VALUE : LA;

<h3>First step</h3>

<p class="indented">
    As stated above, during <span class="text-compare-green">the first step of the algorithm</span>,
    which takes place in each <code>visitXxxInsn</code> method in <code>MethodWriter</code>,
    the state of <span class="text-compare-grey">the output frame</span> of each basic block is updated by simulating the action of the visited instruction.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    It is important to note that the algorithm works at <span class="text-compare-grey">the basic block level</span>, and not at <span class="text-compare-grey">the instruction level</span>.
    This means that <span class="text-compare-grey">input and output frames</span> are associated to <span class="text-compare-grey">basic blocks</span>, and not to individual instructions.
    In practice, they are stored in a <code>Frame</code> object that is associated to a <code>Label</code> object,
    which marks the beginning of <span class="text-compare-grey">basic blocks</span>.

<p class="indented">
    At the beginning, the output frame O1 of the first basic block is completely unknown.
    During the visit of the first instruction, the action of <code>GETSTATIC</code> is simulated:
    the result is that a new value of type <code>B</code> is pushed on the stack,
    on top of the previous values
    (although we know here that the stack is initially empty, we do not take this into account and
    do as if the stack could previously contain any number of values of any type - hence the <code>[?B]</code>).
    During the visit of the second instruction, the output frame O1 is updated to simulate the effect of <code>ASTORE</code>:
    the result is that the value previously pushed on the stack is popped and stored in the local variable 1.
    The visit of the third instruction does not change the output frame O1, but changes <span class="text-compare-grey">the current basic block</span> to <code>null</code>.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    The visit of the <code>L1</code> label makes <code>L1</code> become <span class="text-compare-grey">the new current basic block</span>.
    Like for the first basic block, the output frame O2 of this basic block is initially completely unknown. The visit of the instructions of this basic block is then similar to the visit of the previous instructions.
</p>

<div title="MethodWriter.visitLabel()" class="javacode">
@Override
public void visitLabel(final Label label) {
    // Make it the new current basic block.
    currentBasicBlock = label;
    // Here label.frame should be null.
    label.frame = new Frame(label);
}
</div>

<p class="indented">
    The visit of the <code>L0</code> label makes <code>L0</code> become <span class="text-compare-grey">the new current basic block</span>.
    Here again we start with a completely unknown output frame O3 although,
    in this case, we could start from the value of O2 (since this basic block is a successor of the previous one).
    The <code>ILOAD</code> instruction loads the value of local variable 0,
    which is necessarily of type <code>int</code> (the whole algorithm is based on the assumption that the code is correct), and pushes it on the stack.
    The <code>IFNE</code> instruction consumes this value.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Another effect of simulating the action of the <code>IFNE</code> instruction is to create a new basic block,
    and to make it <span class="text-compare-grey">the new current basic block</span>.
    This is why, although there is no label just after this instruction, <span class="text-key-point">the basic block changes</span>.
    Here again, the output frame O4 of this basic block is initially completely unknown
    (although, as before and for the same reason, we could start from the value of O3).
    The <code>ALOAD</code> instruction loads the value of local variable 1,
    whose type is unknown since the frame is initially completely unknown.
    The only thing we know is that, after the execution of this method,
    the stack contains one additional value whose type is the type of local variable 1
    before this instruction was executed (hence the <code>[?L1]</code>).

<h3>Second step</h3>

<p class="indented">
    During <span class="text-compare-green">the second step of the algorithm</span>, which takes place in the <code>computeAllFrames</code> method,
    the input frames of each basic block are computed by using <span class="text-compare-green">an iterative fix point algorithm</span>
    (i.e. an algorithm to find a fix point <code>x</code> of a function <code>f</code>, defined by <code>f(x)=x</code>.
    If <code>x</code> values define a complete lattice and if <code>f</code> is monotonic,
    <code>x<sub>n+1</sub>=f(x<sub>n</sub>)</code> converges to the smallest fix point of <code>f</code>, according to the <span class="text-emphasize">Tarski theorem</span>.
    Here <code>x</code> is a control flow graph with input and output frames,
    <code>f</code> is a "merge" function and the order relation is based on the subtyping relation for the verification type system).

</p>

<p class="indented">
    First the input frame <code>I1</code> of <span class="text-compare-grey">the first basic block</span>
    is computed from the method descriptor "<code>public static m(Z)LA;</code>", which gives <code>I1 = [I] []</code>.
    Then the first basic block is marked as "changed", and the fix point algorithm starts:

<h2>Uninitialized types</h2>

<p class="indented">
    The simulation of a <code>NEW T</code> instruction results in <span class="text-compare-blue">a special uninitialized type</span> being pushed on the stack.
    This special type contains the offset of the <code>NEW</code> instruction that created it.
    When an <code>INVOKESPECIAL</code> instruction for a <code>T</code> constructor is simulated,
    all occurrences of this special type in the current stack map frame must be replaced with the normal <code>T</code> type.
</p>

<div title="Uninitialized_variable_info" class="plaintext">
Uninitialized_variable_info {
    u1 tag = ITEM_Uninitialized;
    u2 offset;
}
</div>

<p class="indented">
    The basic block input and output frame data structures presented in the previous section are not sufficient to take <span class="text-compare-grey">uninitialized types</span> into account.
    Indeed, when <span class="text-underline">a constructor invocation</span> is visited, the type of the target may be unknown,
    and many local variable and operand stack types may also be unknown.
    It is therefore impossible to replace all occurrences of the target type everywhere in the stack map frame.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    For this reason <span class="text-underline">an additional data structure</span> is associated with <span class="text-compare-grey">each basic block</span>,
    namely <span class="text-compare-grey">the list of types</span> that are initialized in this basic block
    (these types can be relative to the unknown input stack map frame of the basic block).
    This data structure is constructed during the visit of instructions,
    and is used in <code>computeAllFrames</code>, when all the types are known.
</p>


<h2>Exception handlers</h2>

<p class="indented">
    For all the instructions covered by an exception handler, the control flow can jump to the exception handler block. This means that, inside the region covered by an exception handler, and as a consequence of the definition of basic blocks, basic blocks are reduced to individual instructions. In this case the advantage of using an algorithm working at the basic block level is lost, since there are as many basic blocks as instructions.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Hopefully it is not necessary to really use one basic block per instruction inside regions covered by exception handlers. This is because not all the frames associated to these instructions have an impact on the input frame of the exception handler. Indeed this input frame only contains local variable types, and its stack is reduced to a single element that depends only on the type of exception caught by this handler. As a consequence only the frames associated with the instructions that affect local variables are important. In practice, this means that, inside regions covered by exception handlers, xSTORE instructions end the current basic block (and start a new one) like, for instance, an IFEQ instruction.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    As an example, consider the following method:
</p>

<div title="" class="plaintext">
public m(Ljava/lang/Integer;Ljava/lang/Float;)Ljava/lang/Number;
  TRYCATCHBLOCK L0 L1 L1 java/lang/Exception
  ACONST_NULL
  ASTORE 3
 L0
  ALOAD 1
  ASTORE 3
  ALOAD 2
  ASTORE 3
  ALOAD 3
  ARETURN
 L1
  ASTORE 4
  ALOAD 3
  ARETURN
</div>

<p class="indented">
    Normally, due to the exception handler, each instruction between L0 and L1 should be a distinct basic block, which would give 6 basic blocks inside this region. In practice, thanks to the above optimization, only the ASTORE instructions change the current basic block, which gives 3 basic blocks (ALOAD 1 ASTORE 3, ALOAD 2 ASTORE 3 and ALOAD 3 ARETURN). Note that if the instructions between L0 and L1 were considered as a single basic block, the frame computed for L1 would be incorrect: it would indeed be the same as the output frame of the previous block, where local variable 3 is of type Float (whereas the correct value is the common super type of Integer and Float, i.e. Number).
</p>

<p class="indented">
    <b>Note</b>: the edges of the control flow graph that connect basic blocks to exception handler blocks are not constructed in the visitTryCatchBlock method but in the computeAllFrames method. Indeed, since the visitTryCatchBlock method must be called before the labels passed as arguments to this method are visited, it is not possible to know in this method which labels belong to the range protected by this handler.
</p>

<h2>Dead code</h2>

<p class="indented">
    The fix point algorithm used in the second step of the algorithm described in section 3.5.1 is limited to reachable code. Indeed, by definition, reachable code is code that can be reached from the initial basic block in the control flow graph, and the fix point algorithm is precisely looking at these blocks. As a consequence the algorithm does not compute the input frame of dead basic blocks.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Unfortunately the Java 6 split verifier requires a stack map frame for every basic block, even unreachable ones. The problem, as shown above, is that these frames are not computed and, even worse, cannot be computed. Indeed an unreachable basic block can contain illegal bytecode sequences, such as ISTORE 1 ALOAD 1 (more precisely this was possible with the JVM verifier prior to Java 6; but this is no longer possible with the new verifier).
</p>

<p class="indented">
    The consequence of all this is that dead code must either be removed or replaced with a valid bytecode sequence whose stack map frame can be easily computed. The first solution was judged too complicated. So the second solution has been chosen.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    A simple solution is to replace dead code with NOP instructions. In this case any stack map frame will be ok for these blocks. The only problem is that execution can fall from the end of a dead code block to the end of the method or to the start of a reachable block. So either the stack map frame for the dead code block must be consistent with the frame of the next block, or the last instruction of the dead code block must not be replaced with a NOP but with an instruction without successor, such as RETURN, GOTO, or ATHROW.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    The first solution is too complicated; the second one is possible, but the fact that the dead code block can be reduced to a single byte must be taken into account: there is not always enough room to replace it with NOP instructions followed by a GOTO, for example. xRETURN can be used (this is a single byte instruction), but this requires adjustments to the method's return type. The ATHROW instruction does not have this problem, and is also a single byte instruction. It was therefore chosen to end the dead code blocks.
</p>

<p class="indented">
    Note that it is not necessary to insert instructions to create something on stack before ATHROW: the stack map frame for this block can "declare" that, when the execution of this basic block begins, there is already an exception on stack (there will be no consistency problem with other frames since this block is unreachable. Also there is no problem with declared exceptions, because the verifier does not check that ATHROW instructions are consistent with declared exceptions).
</p>

<p class="indented">
    But declaring a stack map frame of the form [] [java/lang/Throwable] for dead basic blocks may cause a problem if this block is in the range of an exception handler: the stack map frame for this handler may be inconsistent, with a non empty list of local variable types (the stack part will always be consistent since it always has the form [exception type] for an exception handler). To solve this, we remove the dead basic blocks from the exception handler ranges (which may remove a handler, decrease its range, or split its range in two sub ranges).
</p>

<p class="indented">
    In summary, the solution for dead code blocks is to replace these blocks with NOP ... NOP ATHROW, to declare a [] [java/lang/Throwable] stack map frame for these blocks, and to remove the dead code blocks from the exception handlers.
