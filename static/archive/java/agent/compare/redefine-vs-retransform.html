    When packing a jar file with custom java agent, you can add the following properties:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Can-Redefine-Classes</li>
    <li>Can-Retransform-Classes</li>
</ul>

<p>
    What is the difference between redefine and retransform?
</p>

<h2>First Difference</h2>

<p>
    They seem almost redundant in the functionality they offer us.
</p>

<p class="text-underline">
    The main difference seems to be that when we <strong>redefine</strong> a class,
    we supply a <code>byte[]</code> with the new definition out of the blue,
    whereas when we <strong>retransform</strong>,
    we get a <code>byte[]</code> containing the current definition via the same API, and we return a modified <code>byte[]</code>.
</p>

<p>
    Therefore, to <strong>redefine</strong>, we need to know more about the class.
    Consider the use-case of injecting profiling trace statements.
    With <strong>retransform</strong> you can do that more directly:
    just look at the bytecode given, modify it, and return it.
    But if we went the <strong>redefine</strong> route,
    we would need to fetch the original <code>byte[]</code> from somewhere (like <code>getResourceAsStream()</code>).
</p>

<h2>Second Difference</h2>

<p>
    Another apparent difference is in how we interact with other class transformers: who goes first.
    Transforms are applied to the original or a redefined class, so several transforms can be additive, for example.
</p>

<p>
    Historically, if we look at the Since comments in the <a class="external" href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/instrument/Instrumentation.html#redefineClasses-java.lang.instrument.ClassDefinition...-" target="_blank">API documentation</a>,
    or on page 238 of <a class="external" href="https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Java-SE-Platform-Professional/dp/159059830X" target="_blank">this book</a> (Friesen 2007 Beginning Java SE 6 Platform),
    we notice that <strong>redefinition</strong> capabilities were introduced in Java 5,
    and <strong>retransformation</strong> in Java 6.
    My guess is that <strong>retransformation</strong> was introduced as a more general capability,
    but <strong>redefinition</strong> had to be retained for backwards compatibility.
</p>

<p>
    Quoting the key sentence about <strong>retransformation</strong> methods from the book linked above:
</p>

<div class="w3-panel w3-light-grey w3-border w3-round">
    <p>
        Agents use these methods to retransform previously loaded classes without needing to access their class files.
    </p>
</div>

<p>
    redefinition happens after the class is loaded, as well as retransformation.
    They happen when you call your <code>Instrumentation</code> instance's <code>redefineClasses(..)</code> and <code>retransformClasses(..)</code> methods, respectively.
</p>

<p>
    Here is a question to any experts passing by:
    is there anything you can do by <strong>redefining</strong> classes,
    that you can't do by <strong>retransforming</strong> them?
    My guess is that the answer is "nothing".
</p>
