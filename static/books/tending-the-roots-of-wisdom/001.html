            Those who preserve their moral integrity suffer only fleeting loneliness. But eternal wretchedness awaits those who toady to the powerful. Wise men fix their gaze on spiritual cultivation, which transcends material things. They wish to leave a good name after them, and choosing fleeting loneliness over eternal wretchedness.

            A man with only slight experience of the world will likewise be only slightly stained with its impurities. A man well versed in the ways of the world will likewise be replete with its tricks and treacheries.
            Therefore, it is better for the upright man to preserve the plainness of his inborn nature than to take pains to acquire worldly wisdom. It is also better for him to remain uninhibited and straightforward than to be equivocal and compromising.

            The heart of a real gentleman is as clear as the blue sky and the broad daylight, so that others may never misunderstand it. But he seldom reveals his talents, which are like a jade hidden in a jadestone.

            A person who shuns power, wealth and luxury is clean. But a man who comes into contact with power, wealth and luxury and still remains unsullied is even cleaner. He who is unacquainted with wiles and intrigues is noble. But a person who is acquainted with wiles and intrigues but scorns to use them is even nobler.

            The frequent hearing of what we do not want to hear, and the frequent pondering of what troubles the mind act like a whetstone upon which we refine our nature and conduct. If everything we hear is pleasant to the ear, and everything we contemplate is pleasant to the mind, that is no different from steeping our lives in poisoned wine.

            When the wind rages and the rain beats down, even the birds seem woebegone. But when the rain ceases to pelt and the wind subsides, the very grass and trees bloom luxuriantly in the fresh sunshine. So, if the world cannot do without a period of sanctified peace during a day's time, then men can definitely not tolerate a single day with their hearts totally bereft of joy.

            Real flavour does not lie in refined liquors or sumptuous dishes; only plain food gives forth a pure taste. The man who has attained the realm of perfect virtue is not the wonder maker who stands out from all his fellows. He is found among the run-of-the-mill.

            Although the Universe seems to be at rest, its components are constantly in motion. The sun and moon whirl night and day, and cast ceaseless and eternal beams. Likewise, a man of noble character must keep himself alert while unoccupied, and enjoy repose while exerting himself.

            In the still of the night, when a man sits alone in meditation, the first thing that happens is that his inordinate desires disappear, and his true self holds sway. Every time this occurs, he enjoys a spontaneous pleasure that comes from within himself. But if, after finding his true self, he feels he cannot cast aside erroneous thoughts, great shame comes upon him.
