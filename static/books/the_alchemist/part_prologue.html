            The alchemist picked up a book that someone in the caravan had brought.
            Leafing through the pages, he found a story about Narcissus.

        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            The alchemist knew the legend of Narcissus, a youth who knelt daily beside a lake to contemplate his own beauty.
            He was so fascinated by himself that, one morning, he fell into the lake and drowned.
            At the spot where he fell, a flower was born, which was called the narcissus.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            But this was not how the author of the book ended the story.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            He said that when Narcissus died, the goddesses of the forest appeared and found the lake,
            which had been fresh water, transformed into a lake of salty tears.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            "Why do you weep?" the goddesses asked.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            "I weep for Narcissus," the lake replied.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            "Ah, it is no surprise that you weep for Narcissus," they said,
            "for though we always pursued him in the forest,
            you alone could contemplate his beauty close at hand."
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            "But . . . was Narcissus beautiful?" the lake asked.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            "Who better than you to know that?" the goddesses said in wonder.
            "After all, it was by your banks that he knelt each day to contemplate himself!"
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            The lake was silent for some time. Finally, it said:
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            "I weep for Narcissus, but I never noticed that Narcissus was beautiful.
            I weep because, each time he knelt beside my banks,
            I could see, in the depths of his eyes, my own beauty reflected."
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            "What a lovely story," the alchemist thought.
