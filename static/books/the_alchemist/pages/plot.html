                A gypsy woman and an old man claiming to be a mysterious king advise him to pursue it.
                &ldquo;<b>To realize one&rsquo;s destiny is a person&rsquo;s only obligation</b>,&rdquo; the old man tells him.

                With the courage of an adventurer, Santiago sells his sheep and travels to Tangier in Africa.

                who unwittingly teaches Santiago important lessons for his longing journey ahead.
                After working at the crystal shop for a year,
                Santiago earns enough money to cover his losses and return home.
                But then something unexpected happens.
                On a desert caravan, Santiago meets an intriguing Englishman.
                The Englishman&rsquo;s passion for knowledge and his relentless quest to uncover the secrets of alchemy
                inspire Santiago to pursue his own dream of finding the treasure.
                As the Englishman searches for the two&ndash;hundred&ndash;year&ndash;old alchemist who resides in the desert oasis,
                Santiago falls in love with a young woman, Fatima.
                Exposed to the greatest and eternal alchemy of all-love-Santiago thinks he has found the treasure.
                But the greatest test of all is yet to come.
                With the help of the alchemist, Santiago completes the last leg of his journey&ndash;dangerous and
                infused with discoveries of the most profound kind&ndash;to find that the treasure he was looking for
                was waiting for him in the place where he least expected.
