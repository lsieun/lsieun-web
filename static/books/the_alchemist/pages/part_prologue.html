            <h2>PROLOGUE</h2>
            <p class="indented">
                The alchemist picked up a book that someone in the caravan had brought.
                Leafing through the pages, he found a story about Narcissus.
                <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                The alchemist knew the legend of Narcissus, a youth who knelt daily beside a lake to contemplate his own beauty.
                He was so fascinated by himself that, one morning, he fell into the lake and drowned.
                At the spot where he fell, a flower was born, which was called the narcissus.
                <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                But this was not how the author of the book ended the story.
                <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                He said that when Narcissus died, the goddesses of the forest appeared and found the lake,
                which had been fresh water, transformed into a lake of salty tears.
                <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                "Why do you weep?" the goddesses asked.
                <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                "I weep for Narcissus," the lake replied.
                <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                "Ah, it is no surprise that you weep for Narcissus," they said,
                "for though we always pursued him in the forest,
                you alone could contemplate his beauty close at hand."
                <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                "But . . . was Narcissus beautiful?" the lake asked.
                <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                "Who better than you to know that?" the goddesses said in wonder.
                "After all, it was by your banks that he knelt each day to contemplate himself!"
                <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                The lake was silent for some time. Finally, it said:
                <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                "I weep for Narcissus, but I never noticed that Narcissus was beautiful.
                I weep because, each time he knelt beside my banks,
                I could see, in the depths of his eyes, my own beauty reflected."
                <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                "What a lovely story," the alchemist thought.
                <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
            </p>
