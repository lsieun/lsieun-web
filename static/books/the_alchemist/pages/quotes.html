            <h2>Quotes</h2>

            <blockquote>
                <div>Whoever you are, or whatever it is that you do, when you really want something, it&rsquo;s because that desire originated in the soul of the universe. It&rsquo;s your mission on earth.</div>
            </blockquote>
            <p>This statement, which Melchizedek says to Santiago upon their first meeting, forms the foundation of the philosophy of The Alchemist. Essentially, Melchizedek says that dreams are not silly or selfish desires that should be ignored. Instead, they serve as the primary means by which people can get in touch with the mystical force that connects everything in the universe. He convinces Santiago that his nagging desire to visit the pyramids is actually a calling, and he sets Santiago on his journey of spiritual discovery. By associating seemingly selfish human desires with the soul of the universe, The Alchemist presents a form of spirituality that differs radically from traditional religions that espouse self-denial. Instead of practicing sympathy by identifying with and helping others, Santiago must focus on his own personal dreams.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <div>We are afraid of losing what we have, whether it&rsquo;s our life or our possessions or our property. But this fear evaporates when we understand that our life stories and the history of the world were written by the same hand.</div>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Here, the camel driver addresses fear while he tells Santiago his life story during the trip to Al-Fayoum. Fear acts as the biggest impediment to achieving one&rsquo;s Personal Legend. Santiago faces many obstacles during his journey, but he regularly feels tempted to abandon his quest when he fears losing what he has already earned. For example, Santiago initially balks at giving up his flock of sheep to Melchizedek. In Tangier, Santiago fears losing the money he earned with the crystal merchant. In the oasis, Santiago fears losing Fatima. Finally, after being captured, Santiago fears he will never be able to turn into the wind. The irony of this fear stems from the fact that Santiago earns ever greater rewards each time he abandons his fear and gives up his previous possessions.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <div>What you still need to know is this: before a dream is realized, the Soul of the World tests everything that was learned along the way. It does this not because it is evil, but so that we can, in addition to realizing our dreams, master the lessons we&rsquo;ve learned as we&rsquo;ve moved toward that dream. That&rsquo;s the point at which, as we say in the language of the desert, one &lsquo;dies of thirst just when the palm trees have appeared on the horizon.&rsquo;
                    &ldquo;Every search begins with beginner&rsquo;s luck. And every search ends with the victor&rsquo;s being severely tested.&rdquo;</div>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The alchemist says these last words to Santiago before the two part ways at the end of the novel. In short, the alchemist explains to Santiago why he had to endure so many trials if the universe, as the alchemist and others have said, does actually want him to fulfill his Personal Legend. Santiago, for instance, may have began his journey with &ldquo;beginner&rsquo;s luck,&rdquo; although only to a limited degree as he was immediately robbed and left penniless in Tangier, but as his quest went on he faced progressively more difficult challenges. When he must turn himself into the wind, Santiago seems as if he has to trick the elements into helping him. But as the alchemist explains, these challenges served their own purpose: to help Santiago master the lessons he had already learned.
                The alchemist&rsquo;s statement implies that the important part of pursuing one&rsquo;s Personal Legend consists not just in reaching the final goal, whether that be turning lead into gold or finding a treasure near the pyramids, but also in learning through action. </p>
