            <h2>Part Two</h2>
            <p class="indented">
                The boy had been working for the crystal merchant for almost a month,
                and he could see that it wasn't exactly the kind of job that would make him happy.
                The merchant spent the entire day mumbling behind the counter,
                telling the boy to be careful with the pieces and not to break anything.
                <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                But he stayed with the job because the merchant, although he was an old grouch, treated him fairly;
                the boy received a good commission for each piece he sold, and had already been able to put some money aside.
                That morning he had done some calculating:
                if he continued to work every day as he had been,
                he would need a whole year to be able to buy some sheep.

            <p class="indented">
                "I'd like to build a display case for the crystal," the boy said to the merchant.
                "We could place it outside, and attract those people who pass at the bottom of the hill."
                <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                "I've never had one before," the merchant answered.
                "People will pass by and bump into it, and pieces will be broken."
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                "Well, when I took my sheep through the fields some of them might have died if we had come upon a snake.
                But that's the way life is with sheep and with shepherds."
                <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                The merchant turned to a customer who wanted three crystal glasses.
                He was selling better than ever. . .
                as if time had turned back to the old days when the street had been one of Tangier's major attractions.
                <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                "Business has really improved," he said to the boy, after the customer had left.
                "I'm doing much better, and soon you'll be able to return to your sheep. Why ask more out of life?"
                <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                "Because we have to respond to omens," the boy said, almost without meaning to;
                then he regretted what he had said, because the merchant had never met the king.
                <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>

            <p class="indented">
                "It's called the principle of favorability, beginner's luck.
                Because life wants you to achieve your destiny," the old king had said.
                <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                But the merchant understood what the boy had said.
                The boy's very presence in the shop was an omen,
                and, as time passed and money was pouring into the cash drawer,
                he had no regrets about having hired the boy.
                The boy was being paid more money than he deserved, because the merchant,
                thinking that sales wouldn't amount to much, had offered the boy a high commission rate.
                He had assumed he would soon return to his sheep.

            <p class="indented">
                "Why did you want to get to the Pyramids?" he asked, to get away from the business of the display.
                <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                "Because I've always heard about them," the boy answered, saying nothing about his dream.
                The treasure was now nothing but a painful memory, and he tried to avoid thinking about it.
                <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                "I don't know anyone around here who would want to cross the desert just to see the Pyramids," said the merchant.
                "They're just a pile of stones. You could build one in your backyard."
                <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                "You've never had dreams of travel," said the boy, turning to wait on a customer who had entered the shop.
                <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                Two days later, the merchant spoke to the boy about the display.
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                "I don't much like change," he said. "You and I aren't like Hassan, that rich merchant.
                <span class="text-key-point">If he makes a buying mistake, it doesn't affect him much. But we two have to live with our mistakes.</span>"
                <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                That's true enough, the boy thought, ruefully.
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                "Why did you think we should have the display?"
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                "I want to get back to my sheep faster.
                We have to take advantage when luck is on our side, and do as much to help it as it's doing to help us.
                It's called the principle of favorability. Or beginner's luck."
                <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                The merchant was silent for a few moments.
                Then he said, "The Prophet gave us the Koran, and left us just five obligations to satisfy during our lives.
                The most important is to believe only in the one true God.
                The others are to pray five times a day, fast during Ramadan, and be charitable to the poor."
                <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                He stopped there.
                His eyes filled with tears as he spoke of the Prophet.
                He was a devout man, and, even with all his impatience,
                he wanted to live his life in accordance with Muslim law.
                <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                "What's the fifth obligation?" the boy asked.
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                "Two days ago, you said that I had never dreamed of travel," the merchant answered.
                "The fifth obligation of every Muslim is a pilgrimage.
                We are obliged, at least once in our lives, to visit the holy city of Mecca.
                <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>

                "Mecca is a lot farther away than the Pyramids.
                When I was young, all I wanted to do was put together enough money to start this shop.
                I thought that someday I'd be rich, and could go to Mecca.
                I began to make some money, but I could never bring myself to leave someone in charge of the shop;
                the crystals are delicate things.
                At the same time, people were passing my shop all the time, heading for Mecca.
                Some of them were rich pilgrims, traveling in caravans with servants and camels,
                but most of the people making the pilgrimage were poorer than I.

            <p class="indented">
                "All who went there were happy at having done so.
                They placed the symbols of the pilgrimage on the doors of their houses.
                One of them, a cobbler who made his living mending boots,
                said that he had traveled for almost a year through the desert,
                but that he got more tired when he had to walk through the streets of Tangier buying his leather."

                "Because it's the thought of Mecca that keeps me alive.

                these mute crystals on the shelves, and lunch and dinner at that same horrible cafe.
                I'm afraid that if my dream is realized, I'll have no reason to go on living.

                I just want to dream about Mecca.
                I've already imagined a thousand times crossing the desert,
                arriving at the Plaza of the Sacred Stone,
                the seven times I walk around it before allowing myself to touch it.
                I've already imagined the people who would be at my side, and those in front of me,
                and the conversations and prayers we would share.
                But I'm afraid that it would all be a disappointment,

                Two more months passed, and the shelf brought many customers into the crystal shop.
                The boy estimated that, if he worked for six more months, he could return to Spain and buy sixty sheep, and yet another sixty.
                In less than a year, he would have doubled his flock, and he would be able to do business with the Arabs,
                because he was now able to speak their strange language.
                Since that morning in the marketplace,
                he had never again made use of Urim and Thummim,
                because Egypt was now just as distant a dream for him as was Mecca for the merchant.
                Anyway, the boy had become happy in his work,
                and thought all the time about the day when he would disembark at Tarifa as a winner.

                Maybe it was his treasure to have wound up in that strange land, met up with a thief,
                and doubled the size of his flock without spending a cent.

                He was proud of himself.
                He had learned some important things, like how to deal in crystal, and about the language without words. . . and about omens.
                One afternoon he had seen a man at the top of the hill,
                complaining that it was impossible to find a decent place to get something to drink after such a climb.
                The boy, accustomed to recognizing omens, spoke to the merchant.

                It made me very depressed.

                They went on smoking the pipe for a while as the sun began to set.
                They were conversing in Arabic, and the boy was proud of himself for being able to do so.
                There had been a time when he thought that his sheep could teach him everything he needed to know about the world.

                As he was leaving, he saw, in the corner of the room, his old shepherd's pouch.
                It was bunched up, and he had hardly thought of it for a long time.
                As he took his jacket out of the pouch, thinking to give it to someone in the street,
                the two stones fell to the floor. Urim and Thummim.

                It made the boy think of the old king, and it startled him to realize how long it had been since he had thought of him.
                For nearly a year, he had been working incessantly,
                thinking only of putting aside enough money so that he could return to Spain with pride.

                I'm going to go back to doing just what I did before, the boy thought.

                But the sheep had taught him something even more important:
                that there was a language in the world that everyone understood,
                a language the boy had used throughout the time that he was trying to improve things at the shop.
                <span class="text-key-point">It was the language of enthusiasm, of things accomplished with love and purpose,
                    and as part of a search for something believed in and desired.</span>
                Tangier was no longer a strange city,
                and he felt that, just as he had conquered this place, he could conquer the world.

                or about people who know what their dreams are but don't want to realize them.
                The old king hadn't told him that the Pyramids were just a pile of stones,
                or that anyone could build one in his backyard.
                And he had forgotten to mention that,
                when you have enough money to buy a flock larger than the one you had before, you should buy it.

                The boy picked up his pouch and put it with his other things.
                He went down the stairs and found the merchant waiting on a foreign couple,
                while two other customers walked about the shop, drinking tea from crystal glasses.
                It was more activity than usual for this time of the morning.
                From where he stood, he saw for the first time that the old merchant's hair was very much like the hair of the old king.
                He remembered the smile of the candy seller, on his first day in Tangier,
                when he had nothing to eat and nowhere to go — that smile had also been like the old king's smile.

                On the other hand, he said that he always appeared to help those who are trying to realize their destiny.

                He had worked for an entire year to make a dream come true, and that dream, minute by minute, was becoming less important.
                Maybe because that wasn't really his dream.

                But as he held Urim and Thurnmim in his hand, they had transmitted to him the strength and will of the old king.
                By coincidence — or maybe it was an omen, the boy thought — he came to the bar he had entered on his first day there.
                The thief wasn't there, and the owner brought him a cup of tea.

                The Englishman could not contain his excitement.
                He canceled all his commitments and pulled together the most important of his books, and now here he was, sitting inside a dusty, smelly warehouse.
                Outside, a huge caravan was being prepared for a crossing of the Sahara, and was scheduled to pass through Al-Fayoum.

                "I'm going into the desert," the man answered, turning back to his reading.

                What he needed to do was review all he had learned over the years,

                The young Arab took out a book and began to read.
                The book was written in Spanish.
                That's good, thought the Englishman.
                He spoke Spanish better than Arabic, and, if this boy was going to Al-Fayoum,
                there would be someone to talk to when there were no other important things to do.

                He still had some doubts about the decision he had made.

                The desert was all sand in some stretches, and rocky in others.
                When the caravan was blocked by a boulder, it had to go around it;
                if there was a large rocky area, they had to make a major detour.
                If the sand was too fine for the animals' hooves, they sought a way where the sand was more substantial.
                In some places, the ground was covered with the salt of dried-up lakes.
                The animals balked at such places, and the camel drivers were forced to dismount and unburden their charges.
                The drivers carried the freight themselves over such treacherous footing, and then reloaded the camels.
                If a guide were to fall ill or die, the camel drivers would draw lots and appoint a new one.

                But all this happened for one basic reason:
                <span class="text-key-point">no matter how many detours and adjustments it made, the caravan moved toward the same compass point</span>.
                Once obstacles were overcome, it returned to its course, sighting on a star that indicated the location of the oasis.
                When the people saw that star shining in the morning sky,
                they knew they were on the right course toward water, palm trees, shelter, and other people.
                It was only the Englishman who was unaware of all this;

                The boy, too, had his book, and he had tried to read it during the first few days of the journey.

                As soon as he had learned to know his camel better, and to establish a relationship with him, he threw the book away.
                Although the boy had developed a superstition that each time he opened the book he would learn something important,

                This Soul of the World allowed them to understand anything on the face of the earth,

                He read the lives of the various people who had succeeded in doing so: Helvetius, Elias, Fulcanelli, and Geber.
                They were fascinating stories: each of them lived out his destiny to the end.
                They traveled, spoke with wise men, performed miracles for the incredulous,

                The only thing he had noticed was that talk of war was becoming more and more frequent.

                Then one day the boy returned the books to the Englishman.
                "Did you learn anything?" the Englishman asked, eager to hear what it might be.
                He needed someone to talk to so as to avoid thinking about the possibility of war.

                The years of research, the magic symbols, the strange words and the laboratory equipment. . .
                none of this had made an impression on the boy.

                "His way isn't the same as mine, nor mine as his.

                The caravan began to travel day and night.
                The hooded Bedouins reappeared more and more frequently, and the camel driver —
                who had become a good friend of the boy's —
                explained that the war between the tribes had already begun.
                The caravan would be very lucky to reach the oasis.

                The animals were exhausted, and the men talked among themselves less and less.
                The silence was the worst aspect of the night,

                which before had been nothing but the groan of a camel —

                Two nights later, as he was getting ready to bed down, the boy looked for the star they followed every night.

                There, in front of him, where the small stars had been the night before,
                was an endless row of date palms, stretching across the entire desert.

                He was at home with the silence of the desert, and he was content just to look at the trees.
                He still had a long way to go to reach the pyramids, and someday this morning would just be a memory.
                But this was the present moment —
                the party the camel driver had mentioned —
                and he wanted to live it as he did the lessons of his past and his dreams of the future.
                Although the vision of the date palms would someday be just a memory,
                right now it signified shade, water, and a refuge from the war.
                Yesterday, the camel's groan signaled danger, and now a row of date palms could herald a miracle.

                The times rush past, and so do the caravans, thought the alchemist, as he watched the hundreds of people and animals arriving at the oasis.
                People were shouting at the new arrivals, dust obscured the desert sun, and the children of the oasis were bursting with excitement at the arrival of the strangers.
                The alchemist saw the tribal chiefs greet the leader of the caravan, and converse with him at length.

            <p class="indented">
                But none of that mattered to the alchemist.
                He had already seen many people come and go, and the desert remained as it was.
                He had seen kings and beggars walking the desert sands.
                The dunes were changed constantly by the wind, yet these were the same sands he had known since he was a child.
                He always enjoyed seeing the happiness that the travelers experienced when, after weeks of yellow sand and blue sky,
                they first saw the green of the date palms.
                Maybe God created the desert so that man could
                appreciate the date trees, he thought.

                He decided to concentrate on more practical matters.
                He knew that in the caravan there was a man to whom he was to teach some of his secrets.
                The omens had told him so. He didn't know the man yet,
                but his practiced eye would recognize him when he appeared.
                He hoped that it would be someone as capable as his previous apprentice.

                I don't know why these things have to be transmitted by word of mouth, he thought.
                It wasn't exactly that they were secrets; God revealed his secrets easily to all his creatures.

                The boy couldn't believe what he was seeing:
                the oasis, rather than being just a well surrounded by a few palm trees —
                as he had seen once in a geography book —
                was much larger than many towns back in Spain.
                There were three hundred wells, fifty thousand date trees, and innumerable colored tents spread among them.

                They were surrounded by children, curious to look at the animals and people that were arriving.
                The men of the oasis wanted to know if they had seen any fighting,
                and the women competed with one another for access to the cloth and precious stones brought by the merchants.
                The silence of the desert was a distant dream;
                the travelers in the caravan were talking incessantly, laughing and shouting,
                as if they had emerged from the spiritual world and found themselves once again in the world of people.
                They were relieved and happy.

                They had been taking careful precautions in the desert,
                but the camel driver explained to the boy that oases were always considered to be neutral territories,
                because the majority of the inhabitants were women and children.
                There were oases throughout the desert, but the tribesmen fought in the desert,
                leaving the oases as places of refuge.

                With some difficulty, the leader of the caravan brought all his people together and gave them his instructions.
                The group was to remain there at the oasis until the conflict between the tribes was over.
                Since they were visitors, they would have to share living space with those who lived there,
                and would be given the best accommodations.
                That was the law of hospitality.
                Then he asked that everyone, including his own sentinels, hand over their arms to the men appointed by the tribal chieftains.

                To the boy's surprise, the Englishman took a chrome-plated revolver out of his bag and gave it to the men who were collecting the arms.

                Meanwhile, the boy thought about his treasure.
                The closer he got to the realization of his dream, the more difficult things became.
                It seemed as if what the old king had called "beginner's luck" were no longer functioning.
                In his pursuit of the dream, he was being constantly subjected to tests of his persistence and courage.
                So he could not be hasty, nor impatient.
                If he pushed forward impulsively, he would fail to see the signs and omens left by God along his path.

                God placed them along my path. He had surprised himself with the thought.
                Until then, he had considered the omens to be things of this world.
                Like eating or sleeping, or like seeking love or finding a job.
                He had never thought of them in terms of a language used by God to indicate what he should do.

                That first day, everyone slept from exhaustion, including the Englishman.
                The boy was assigned a place far from his friend, in a tent with five other young men of about his age.
                They were people of the desert, and clamored to hear his stories about the great cities.

                First, they tried to find him on their own.
                An alchemist would probably live in a manner that was different from that of the rest of the people at the oasis,
                and it was likely that in his tent an oven was continuously burning.
                They searched everywhere, and found that the oasis was much larger than they could have imagined; there were hundreds of tents.

                The Englishman didn't want to tell others about his reasons for being at the oasis, and couldn't make up his mind.
                But, finally, he agreed that the boy, who spoke better Arabic than he, should do so.
                The boy approached a woman who had come to the well to fill a goatskin with water.

                The woman said she had never heard of such a person, and hurried away.
                But before she fled, she advised the boy that he had better not try to converse with women who were dressed in black,

                The Englishman was disappointed.
                It seemed he had made the long journey for nothing.
                The boy was also saddened; his friend was in pursuit of his destiny.
                And, when someone was in such pursuit, the entire universe made an effort to help him succeed — that's what the old king had said.
                He couldn't have been wrong.

                The Englishman's eyes lit up.

                Finally, a young woman approached who was not dressed in black.
                She had a vessel on her shoulder, and her head was covered by a veil, but her face was uncovered.

                At that moment, it seemed to him that time stood still, and the Soul of the World surged within him.
                When he looked into her dark eyes, and saw that her lips were poised between a laugh and silence,
                he learned the most important part of the language that all the world spoke —
                the language that everyone on earth was capable of understanding in their heart.
                It was love. Something older than humanity, more ancient than the desert.
                Something that exerted the same force whenever two pairs of eyes met, as had theirs here at the well.
                She smiled, and that was certainly an omen — the omen he had been awaiting, without even knowing he was, for all his life.
                The omen he had sought to find with his sheep and in his books, in the crystals and in the silence of the desert.

            <p class="indented">
                It was the pure Language of the World.
                It required no explanation, just as the universe needs none as it travels through endless time.
                What the boy felt at that moment was that he was in the presence of the only woman in his life,
                and that, with no need for words, she recognized the same thing.
                He was more certain of it than of anything in the world.
                He had been told by his parents and grandparents that he must fall in love and really know a person before becoming committed.
                But maybe people who felt that way had never learned the universal language.
                Because, <span class="text-key-point">when you know that language, it's easy to understand that someone in the world awaits you,
                whether it's in the middle of the desert or in some great city.</span>
                And when two such people encounter each other, and their eyes meet, the past and the future become unimportant.
                There is only that moment, and the incredible certainty that everything under the sun has been written by one hand only.
                It is the hand that evokes love, and creates a twin soul for every person in the world.
                Without such love, one's dreams would have no meaning.

                He was surprised when he saw that the Englishman had built himself a furnace outside his tent.
                It was a strange furnace, fueled by firewood, with a transparent flask heating on top.
                As the Englishman stared out at the desert, his eyes seemed brighter than they had when he was reading his books.

                He continued to feed the fire, and the boy stayed on until the desert turned pink in the setting sun.
                He felt the urge to go out into the desert, to see if its silence held the answers to his questions.

                He wandered for a while, keeping the date palms of the oasis within sight.
                He listened to the wind, and felt the stones beneath his feet.
                Here and there, he found a shell, and realized that the desert, in remote times, had been a sea.
                He sat on a stone, and allowed himself to become hypnotized by the horizon.
                He tried to deal with the concept of love as distinct from possession, and couldn't separate them.
                But Fatima was a woman of the desert, and, if anything could help him to understand, it was the desert.

                As he sat there thinking, he sensed movement above him.
                Looking up, he saw a pair of hawks flying high in the sky.

                He watched the hawks as they drifted on the wind.
                Although their flight appeared to have no pattern, it made a certain kind of sense to the boy.
                It was just that he couldn't grasp what it meant.
                He followed the movement of the birds, trying to read something into it.
                Maybe these desert birds could explain to him the meaning of love without ownership.

                and everything in the world is beginning to make sense to me. . . even the flight of the hawks," he said to himself.
                And, in that mood, he was grateful to be in love.

                Suddenly, one of the hawks made a flashing dive through the sky, attacking the other.
                As it did so, a sudden, fleeting image came to the boy: an army, with its swords at the ready, riding into the oasis.
                The vision vanished immediately, but it had shaken him.
                He had heard people speak of mirages, and had already seen some himself:
                <span class="text-key-point">they were desires that, because of their intensity, materialized over the sands of the desert.</span>

                The desert was full of men who earned their living based on the ease with which they could penetrate to the Soul of the World.
                They were known as seers, and they were held in fear by women and the elderly.
                Tribesmen were also wary of consulting them,
                because it would be impossible to be effective in battle if one knew that he was fated to die.
                The tribesmen preferred the taste of battle, and the thrill of not knowing what the outcome would be;
                the future was already written by Allah, and what he had written was always for the good of man.
                So the tribesmen lived only for the present, because the present was full of surprises,
                and they had to be aware of many things: Where was the enemy's sword?
                Where was his horse? What kind of blow should one deliver next in order to remain alive?
                The camel driver was not a fighter, and he had consulted with seers.
                Many of them had been right about what they said, while some had been wrong.
                Then, one day, the oldest seer he had ever sought out (and the one most to be feared)
                had asked why the camel driver was so interested in the future.

                The ground was covered with the most beautiful carpets he had ever walked upon,

                The boy became fearful; the omens told him that something was wrong.

                The man hadn't participated in the discussion, and, in fact, hadn't said a word up to that point.
                But the boy was already used to the Language of the World, and he could feel the vibrations of peace throughout the tent.
                Now his intuition was that he had been right in coming.

                The chieftains were silent for a few moments as they listened to what the old man was saying.
                Then he turned to the boy: this time his expression was cold and distant.

                "Two thousand years ago, in a distant land, a man who believed in dreams was thrown into a dungeon and then sold as a slave," the old man said,
                now in the dialect the boy understood.
                "Our merchants bought that man, and brought him to Egypt.
                All of us know that whoever believes in dreams also knows how to interpret them."

                He, too, was a stranger in a strange land, like you, and he was probably about your age."

                "We always observe the Tradition.

                When the sun sets, the men will once again surrender their arms to me.

                He was alarmed by what had happened.

                It was a frightening bet.
                But he had been making risky bets ever since the day he had sold his sheep to pursue his destiny.
                And, as the camel driver had said, <span class="text-key-point">to die tomorrow was no worse than dying on any other day.

                Walking along in the silence, he had no regrets.
                If he died tomorrow, it would be because God was not willing to change the future.
                He would at least have died after having crossed the strait,
                after having worked in a crystal shop, and after having known the silence of the desert and Fatima's eyes.
                He had lived every one of his days intensely since he had left home so long ago.
                If he died tomorrow, he would already have seen more than other shepherds, and he was proud of that.

                Suddenly he heard a thundering sound, and he was thrown to the ground by a wind such as he had never known.
                The area was swirling in dust so intense that it hid the moon from view.
                Before him was an enormous white horse, rearing over him with a frightening scream.

                When the blinding dust had settled a bit, the boy trembled at what he saw.
                Astride the animal was a horseman dressed completely in black, with a falcon perched on his left shoulder.
                He wore a turban and his entire face, except for his eyes, was covered with a black kerchief.
                He appeared to be a messenger from the desert, but his presence was much more powerful than that of a mere messenger.

                The strange horseman drew an enormous, curved sword from a scabbard mounted on his saddle.

                "It is I who dared to do so," said the boy.

                And for Fatima. The omens had been true, after all.
                Here he was, face-to-face with his enemy, but there was no need to be concerned about dying — the Soul of the World awaited him,
                and he would soon be a part of it.

                The mounted troops entered the oasis from the north;
                it appeared to be a peaceful expedition, but they all carried arms hidden in their robes.

                The women had remained in their tents, praying for the safekeeping of their husbands, and saw nothing of the battle, either.

                The commander said that his men had been starving and thirsty, exhausted from many days of battle,

                "Sit down. We'll have something to drink and eat these hawks," said the alchemist.
                <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>

            <p class="indented">
                The boy suspected that they were the same hawks he had seen on the day before, but he said nothing.
                The alchemist lighted the fire, and soon a delicious aroma filled the tent.
                It was better than the scent of the hookahs.

                "Because of the omens," the alchemist answered. "The wind told me you would be coming, and that you would need help."

                said the alchemist, echoing the words of the old king.
                The boy understood. Another person was there to help him toward his destiny.

                They ate in silence. The alchemist opened a bottle and poured a red liquid into the boy's cup.
                It was the most delicious wine he had ever tasted.

            <p class="indented">
                The alchemist was a bit daunting, but, as the boy drank the wine, he relaxed.
                After they finished eating they sat outside the tent, under a moon so brilliant that it made the stars pale.

            <p class="indented">
                The following night, the boy appeared at the alchemist's tent with a horse.
                The alchemist was ready, and
                he mounted his own steed and placed the falcon on his left shoulder.
                He said to the boy, "Show me where there is life out in the desert. Only those who can see such signs of life are able to find treasure."
                <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                They began to ride out over the sands, with the moon lighting their way.
                I don't know if I'll be able to find life in the desert, the boy thought. I don't know the desert that well yet.
                <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                He wanted to say so to the alchemist, but he was afraid of the man.
                They reached the rocky place where the boy had seen the hawks in the sky, but now there was only silence and the wind.
                <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                "I don't know how to find life in the desert," the boy said.
                "I know that there is life here, but I don't know where to look."
                <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                "Life attracts life," the alchemist answered.
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                And then the boy understood.
                He loosened the reins on his horse, who galloped forward over the rocks and sand.
                The alchemist followed as the boy's horse ran for almost half an hour.
                They could no longer see the palms of the oasis — only the gigantic moon above them,
                and its silver reflections from the stones of the desert. Suddenly, for no apparent reason, the boy's horse began to slow.
                <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                "There's life here," the boy said to the alchemist.
                "I don't know the language of the desert, but my horse knows the language of life."
                <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                They dismounted, and the alchemist said nothing. Advancing slowly, they searched among the stones.
                The alchemist stopped abruptly, and bent to the ground.
                There was a hole there among the stones.
                The alchemist put his hand into the hole, and then his entire arm, up to his shoulder.
                Something was moving there, and the alchemist's eyes — the boy could see only his eyes-squinted with his effort.
                His arm seemed to be battling with whatever was in the hole.
                Then, with a motion that startled the boy, he withdrew his arm and leaped to his feet.
                In his hand, he grasped a snake by the tail.
                <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                The boy leapt as well, but away from the alchemist.
                The snake fought frantically, making hissing sounds that shattered the silence of the desert.
                It was a cobra, whose venom could kill a person in minutes.
                <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                "Watch out for his venom," the boy said.
                But even though the alchemist had put his hand in the hole, and had surely already been bitten, his expression was calm.
                "The alchemist is two hundred years old," the Englishman had told him. He must know how to deal with the snakes of the desert.
                <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                The boy watched as his companion went to his horse and withdrew a scimitar.
                With its blade, he drew a circle in the sand, and then he placed the snake within it.
                The serpent relaxed immediately.
