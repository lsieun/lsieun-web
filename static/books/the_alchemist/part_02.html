            The boy had been working for the crystal merchant for almost a month,
            and he could see that it wasn't exactly the kind of job that would make him happy.
            The merchant spent the entire day mumbling behind the counter,
            telling the boy to be careful with the pieces and not to break anything.

        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            But he stayed with the job because the merchant, although he was an old grouch, treated him fairly;
            the boy received a good commission for each piece he sold, and had already been able to put some money aside.
            That morning he had done some calculating:
            if he continued to work every day as he had been,
            he would need a whole year to be able to buy some sheep.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            "I'd like to build a display case for the crystal," the boy said to the merchant.
            "We could place it outside, and attract those people who pass at the bottom of the hill."
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            "I've never had one before," the merchant answered.
            "People will pass by and bump into it, and pieces will be broken."
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            "Well, when I took my sheep through the fields some of them might have died if we had come upon a snake.
            But that's the way life is with sheep and with shepherds."
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            The merchant turned to a customer who wanted three crystal glasses.
            He was selling better than ever. . .
            as if time had turned back to the old days when the street had been one of Tangier's major attractions.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            "Business has really improved," he said to the boy, after the customer had left.
            "I'm doing much better, and soon you'll be able to return to your sheep. Why ask more out of life?"
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            "Because we have to respond to omens," the boy said, almost without meaning to;
            then he regretted what he had said, because the merchant had never met the king.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>

        <p class="indented">
            "It's called the principle of favorability, beginner's luck.
            Because life wants you to achieve your destiny," the old king had said.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            But the merchant understood what the boy had said.
            The boy's very presence in the shop was an omen,
            and, as time passed and money was pouring into the cash drawer,
            he had no regrets about having hired the boy.
            The boy was being paid more money than he deserved, because the merchant,
            thinking that sales wouldn't amount to much, had offered the boy a high commission rate.
            He had assumed he would soon return to his sheep.

        <p class="indented">
            "Why did you want to get to the Pyramids?" he asked, to get away from the business of the display.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            "Because I've always heard about them," the boy answered, saying nothing about his dream.
            The treasure was now nothing but a painful memory, and he tried to avoid thinking about it.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            "I don't know anyone around here who would want to cross the desert just to see the Pyramids," said the merchant.
            "They're just a pile of stones. You could build one in your backyard."
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            "You've never had dreams of travel," said the boy, turning to wait on a customer who had entered the shop.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            Two days later, the merchant spoke to the boy about the display.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            "I don't much like change," he said. "You and I aren't like Hassan, that rich merchant.
            <span class="text-key-point">If he makes a buying mistake, it doesn't affect him much. But we two have to live with our mistakes.</span>"
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            That's true enough, the boy thought, ruefully.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            "Why did you think we should have the display?"
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            "I want to get back to my sheep faster.
            We have to take advantage when luck is on our side, and do as much to help it as it's doing to help us.
            It's called the principle of favorability. Or beginner's luck."
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            The merchant was silent for a few moments.
            Then he said, "The Prophet gave us the Koran, and left us just five obligations to satisfy during our lives.
            The most important is to believe only in the one true God.
            The others are to pray five times a day, fast during Ramadan, and be charitable to the poor."
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            He stopped there.
            His eyes filled with tears as he spoke of the Prophet.
            He was a devout man, and, even with all his impatience,
            he wanted to live his life in accordance with Muslim law.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            "What's the fifth obligation?" the boy asked.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            "Two days ago, you said that I had never dreamed of travel," the merchant answered.
            "The fifth obligation of every Muslim is a pilgrimage.
            We are obliged, at least once in our lives, to visit the holy city of Mecca.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>

        <p class="indented">
            "Mecca is a lot farther away than the Pyramids.
            When I was young, all I wanted to do was put together enough money to start this shop.
            I thought that someday I'd be rich, and could go to Mecca.
            I began to make some money, but I could never bring myself to leave someone in charge of the shop;
            the crystals are delicate things.
            At the same time, people were passing my shop all the time, heading for Mecca.
            Some of them were rich pilgrims, traveling in caravans with servants and camels,
            but most of the people making the pilgrimage were poorer than I.

        <p class="indented">
            "All who went there were happy at having done so.
            They placed the symbols of the pilgrimage on the doors of their houses.
            One of them, a cobbler who made his living mending boots,
            said that he had traveled for almost a year through the desert,
            but that he got more tired when he had to walk through the streets of Tangier buying his leather."

        <p class="indented">
            "Well, why don't you go to Mecca now?" asked the boy.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            "Because it's the thought of Mecca that keeps me alive.
            That's what helps me face these days that are all the same,
            these mute crystals on the shelves, and lunch and dinner at that same horrible cafe.
            I'm afraid that if my dream is realized, I'll have no reason to go on living.

            "You dream about your sheep and the Pyramids,
            but you're different from me, because you want to realize your dreams.
            I just want to dream about Mecca.
            I've already imagined a thousand times crossing the desert,
            arriving at the Plaza of the Sacred Stone,
            the seven times I walk around it before allowing myself to touch it.
            I've already imagined the people who would be at my side, and those in front of me,
            and the conversations and prayers we would share.
            But I'm afraid that it would all be a disappointment,
            so I prefer just to dream about it."

            That day, the merchant gave the boy permission to build the display.

            Two more months passed, and the shelf brought many customers into the crystal shop.
            The boy estimated that, if he worked for six more months, he could return to Spain and buy sixty sheep, and yet another sixty.
            In less than a year, he would have doubled his flock, and he would be able to do business with the Arabs,
            because he was now able to speak their strange language.
            Since that morning in the marketplace,
            he had never again made use of Urim and Thummim,
            because Egypt was now just as distant a dream for him as was Mecca for the merchant.
            Anyway, the boy had become happy in his work,
            and thought all the time about the day when he would disembark at Tarifa as a winner.

            "<span class="text-key-point">You must always know what it is that you want</span>," the old king had said.
            The boy knew, and was now working toward it.
            Maybe it was his treasure to have wound up in that strange land, met up with a thief,
            and doubled the size of his flock without spending a cent.

            He was proud of himself.
            He had learned some important things, like how to deal in crystal, and about the language without words. . . and about omens.
            One afternoon he had seen a man at the top of the hill,
            complaining that it was impossible to find a decent place to get something to drink after such a climb.
            The boy, accustomed to recognizing omens, spoke to the merchant.

        <p class="indented">
            "But we could sell tea in crystal glasses.
            The people will enjoy the tea and want to buy the glasses.

            The merchant didn't respond, but that afternoon,
            after saying his prayers and closing the shop,
            he invited the boy to sit with him and share his hookah,
            that strange pipe used by the Arabs.

            I know good crystal from bad, and everything else there is to know about crystal.
            I know its dimensions and how it behaves.
            If we serve tea in crystal, the shop is going to expand.
            And then I'll have to change my way of life."

            "I'm already used to the way things are.
            Before you came, I was thinking about how much time I had wasted in the same place,
            while my friends had moved on, and either went bankrupt or did better than they had before.
            It made me very depressed.
            Now, I can see that it hasn't been too bad.
            The shop is exactly the size I always wanted it to be.
            I don't want to change anything, because I don't know how to deal with change.

            The old man continued, "You have been a real blessing to me.
            Today, I understand something I didn't see before: every blessing ignored becomes a curse.
            I don't want anything else in life.
            But you are forcing me to look at wealth and at horizons I have never known.
            Now that I have seen them, and now that I see how immense my possibilities are,
            I'm going to feel worse than I did before you arrived.

            They went on smoking the pipe for a while as the sun began to set.
            They were conversing in Arabic, and the boy was proud of himself for being able to do so.
            There had been a time when he thought that his sheep could teach him everything he needed to know about the world.
            But they could never have taught him Arabic.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>

        <p class="indented">
            There are probably other things in the world that the sheep can't teach me, thought the boy as he regarded the old merchant.
            All they ever do, really, is look for food and water.
            And maybe it wasn't that they were teaching me, but that I was learning from them.

            The other man remarked that tea was always more delicious when it was served in crystal,

            The boy went to his room and packed his belongings.
            They filled three sacks.
            As he was leaving, he saw, in the corner of the room, his old shepherd's pouch.
            It was bunched up, and he had hardly thought of it for a long time.
            As he took his jacket out of the pouch, thinking to give it to someone in the street,
            the two stones fell to the floor. Urim and Thummim.

            It made the boy think of the old king, and it startled him to realize how long it had been since he had thought of him.
            For nearly a year, he had been working incessantly,
            thinking only of putting aside enough money so that he could return to Spain with pride.

            The boy picked up Urim and Thummim, and, once again, had the strange sensation that the old king was nearby.
            He had worked hard for a year, and the omens were that it was time to go.

            But the sheep had taught him something even more important:
            that there was a language in the world that everyone understood,
            a language the boy had used throughout the time that he was trying to improve things at the shop.
            <span class="text-key-point">It was the language of enthusiasm, of things accomplished with love and purpose,
                    and as part of a search for something believed in and desired.</span>
            Tangier was no longer a strange city,
            and he felt that, just as he had conquered this place, he could conquer the world.

            But the old king hadn't said anything about being robbed, or about endless deserts,
            or about people who know what their dreams are but don't want to realize them.
            The old king hadn't told him that the Pyramids were just a pile of stones,
            or that anyone could build one in his backyard.
            And he had forgotten to mention that,
            when you have enough money to buy a flock larger than the one you had before, you should buy it.

            The boy picked up his pouch and put it with his other things.
            He went down the stairs and found the merchant waiting on a foreign couple,
            while two other customers walked about the shop, drinking tea from crystal glasses.
            It was more activity than usual for this time of the morning.
            From where he stood, he saw for the first time that the old merchant's hair was very much like the hair of the old king.
            He remembered the smile of the candy seller, on his first day in Tangier,
            when he had nothing to eat and nowhere to go — that smile had also been like the old king's smile.

            He said that to himself with certainty, but he was no longer happy with his decision.
            He had worked for an entire year to make a dream come true, and that dream, minute by minute, was becoming less important.
            Maybe because that wasn't really his dream.

            Who knows. . . maybe it's better to be like the crystal merchant: never go to Mecca,
            and just go through life wanting to do so, he thought, again trying to convince himself.
            But as he held Urim and Thurnmim in his hand, they had transmitted to him the strength and will of the old king.
            By coincidence — or maybe it was an omen, the boy thought — he came to the bar he had entered on his first day there.

            But maybe I'll never have another chance to get to the Pyramids in Egypt.
            The old man wore a breastplate of gold, and he knew about my past. He really was a king, a wise king.

            Yet the boy felt that there was another way to regard his situation:
            he was actually two hours closer to his treasure. . . the fact that the two hours had stretched into an entire year didn't matter.

            If I don't find it, I can always go home. I finally have enough money, and all the time I need. Why not?

            All his life and all his studies were aimed at finding the one true language of the universe.
            First he had studied Esperanto, then the world's religions, and now it was alchemy.
            He knew how to speak Esperanto, he understood all the major religions well, but he wasn't yet an alchemist.
            He had unraveled the truths behind important questions,

            He had tried in vain to establish a relationship with an alchemist.
            But the alchemists were strange people, who thought only about themselves, and almost always refused to help him.
            Who knows, maybe they had failed to discover the secret of the Master Work — the Philosopher's Stone — and for this reason kept their knowledge to themselves.

            and had purchased all the rarest and most important volumes on alchemy.
            In one he had read that, many years ago, a famous Arabian alchemist had visited Europe.
            It was said that he was more than two hundred years old, and that he had discovered the Philosopher's Stone and the Elixir of Life.
            The Englishman had been profoundly impressed by the story.
            But he would never have thought it more than just a myth, had not a friend of his —
            retorting from an archaeological expedition in the desert —
            told him about an Arab that was possessed of exceptional powers.

            The wind never stopped, and the boy remembered the day he had sat at the fort in Tarifa with this same wind blowing in his face.
            It reminded him of the wool from his sheep. . .
            his sheep who were now seeking food and water in the fields of Andalusia, as they always had.

            after all, he probably wasn't the only one.
            But he was excited at his intuitive understanding of the camel driver's comment:
            maybe he was also learning the universal language that deals with the past and the present of all people.
            "Hunches," his mother used to call them.
            The boy was beginning to understand that <span class="text-key-point">intuition is really a sudden immersion of the soul into the universal current of life,

            The desert was all sand in some stretches, and rocky in others.
            When the caravan was blocked by a boulder, it had to go around it;
            if there was a large rocky area, they had to make a major detour.
            If the sand was too fine for the animals' hooves, they sought a way where the sand was more substantial.
            In some places, the ground was covered with the salt of dried-up lakes.
            The animals balked at such places, and the camel drivers were forced to dismount and unburden their charges.
            The drivers carried the freight themselves over such treacherous footing, and then reloaded the camels.
            If a guide were to fall ill or die, the camel drivers would draw lots and appoint a new one.

            <span class="text-key-point">no matter how many detours and adjustments it made, the caravan moved toward the same compass point</span>.
            Once obstacles were overcome, it returned to its course, sighting on a star that indicated the location of the oasis.
            When the people saw that star shining in the morning sky,
            they knew they were on the right course toward water, palm trees, shelter, and other people.
            It was only the Englishman who was unaware of all this;
            he was, for the most part, immersed in reading his books.

            The boy, too, had his book, and he had tried to read it during the first few days of the journey.
            But he found it much more interesting to observe the caravan and listen to the wind.
            As soon as he had learned to know his camel better, and to establish a relationship with him, he threw the book away.
            Although the boy had developed a superstition that each time he opened the book he would learn something important,
            he decided it was an unnecessary burden.

            They were strange books.
            They spoke about mercury, salt, dragons, and kings, and he didn't understand any of it.

            The book that most interested the boy told the stories of the famous alchemists.
            They were men who had dedicated their entire lives to the purification of metals in their laboratories;
            they believed that, if a metal were heated for many years, it would free itself of all its individual properties,
            and what was left would be the Soul of the World.
            This Soul of the World allowed them to understand anything on the face of the earth,
            because it was the language with which all things communicated.
            They called that discovery the Master Work — it was part liquid and part solid.

        <p class="indented">
            The boy learned that the liquid part of the Master Work was called the Elixir of Life,
            and that it cured all illnesses;
            it also kept the alchemist from growing old.
            And the solid part was called the Philosopher's Stone.

        <p class="indented">
            "It's not easy to find the Philosopher's Stone," said the Englishman.
            "The alchemists spent years in their laboratories, observing the fire that purified the metals.
            They spent so much time close to the fire that gradually they gave up the vanities of the world.
            They discovered that the purification of the metals had led to a purification of themselves."

            The boy thought about the crystal merchant.
            He had said that <span class="text-key-point">it was a good thing for the boy to clean the crystal pieces, so that he could free himself from negative thoughts.</span>
            The boy was becoming more and more convinced that alchemy could be learned in one's daily life.

            "Also," said the Englishman, "the Philosopher's Stone has a fascinating property.

        <p class="indented">
            Having heard that, the boy became even more interested in alchemy.
            He thought that, with some patience, he'd be able to transform everything into gold.
            He read the lives of the various people who had succeeded in doing so: Helvetius, Elias, Fulcanelli, and Geber.
            They were fascinating stories: each of them lived out his destiny to the end.
            They traveled, spoke with wise men, performed miracles for the incredulous,
            and owned the Philosopher's Stone and the Elixir of Life.

            But when the boy wanted to learn how to achieve the Master Work, he became completely lost.

        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            "They didn't have the printing press in those days," the boy argued.
            "There was no way for everybody to know about alchemy. Why did they use such strange language, with so many drawings?"
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            The Englishman didn't answer him directly.
            He said that for the past few days he had been paying attention to how the caravan operated,
            but that he hadn't learned anything new.
            The only thing he had noticed was that talk of war was becoming more and more frequent.

            Then one day the boy returned the books to the Englishman.
            "Did you learn anything?" the Englishman asked, eager to hear what it might be.
            He needed someone to talk to so as to avoid thinking about the possibility of war.

            The years of research, the magic symbols, the strange words and the laboratory equipment. . .
            none of this had made an impression on the boy.
            His soul must be too primitive to understand those things, he thought.

        <p class="indented">
            The boy went back to contemplating the silence of the desert, and the sand raised by the animals.
            "Everyone has his or her own way of learning things," he said to himself.
            "His way isn't the same as mine, nor mine as his.

            The caravan began to travel day and night.
            The hooded Bedouins reappeared more and more frequently, and the camel driver —
            who had become a good friend of the boy's —
            explained that the war between the tribes had already begun.
            The caravan would be very lucky to reach the oasis.

        <p class="indented">
            The animals were exhausted, and the men talked among themselves less and less.
            The silence was the worst aspect of the night,
            when the mere groan of a camel —
            which before had been nothing but the groan of a camel —
            now frightened everyone, because it might signal a raid.

            "I'm alive," he said to the boy, as they ate a bunch of dates one night, with no fires and no moon.
            "When I'm eating, that's all I think about.
            If I'm on the march, I just concentrate on marching.

            You'll see that there is life in the desert, that there are stars in the heavens,
            and that tribesmen fight because they are part of the human race.

            Two nights later, as he was getting ready to bed down, the boy looked for the star they followed every night.
            He thought that the horizon was a bit lower than it had been, because he seemed to see stars on the desert itself.

            The boy awoke as the sun rose.
            There, in front of him, where the small stars had been the night before,
            was an endless row of date palms, stretching across the entire desert.

            He was at home with the silence of the desert, and he was content just to look at the trees.
            He still had a long way to go to reach the pyramids, and someday this morning would just be a memory.
            But this was the present moment —
            the party the camel driver had mentioned —
            and he wanted to live it as he did the lessons of his past and his dreams of the future.
            Although the vision of the date palms would someday be just a memory,
            right now it signified shade, water, and a refuge from the war.
            Yesterday, the camel's groan signaled danger, and now a row of date palms could herald a miracle.

            The times rush past, and so do the caravans, thought the alchemist, as he watched the hundreds of people and animals arriving at the oasis.
            People were shouting at the new arrivals, dust obscured the desert sun, and the children of the oasis were bursting with excitement at the arrival of the strangers.
            The alchemist saw the tribal chiefs greet the leader of the caravan, and converse with him at length.

        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            But none of that mattered to the alchemist.
            He had already seen many people come and go, and the desert remained as it was.
            He had seen kings and beggars walking the desert sands.
            The dunes were changed constantly by the wind, yet these were the same sands he had known since he was a child.
            He always enjoyed seeing the happiness that the travelers experienced when, after weeks of yellow sand and blue sky,
            they first saw the green of the date palms.
            Maybe God created the desert so that man could
            appreciate the date trees, he thought.

        <p class="indented">
            He decided to concentrate on more practical matters.
            He knew that in the caravan there was a man to whom he was to teach some of his secrets.
            The omens had told him so. He didn't know the man yet,
            but his practiced eye would recognize him when he appeared.
            He hoped that it would be someone as capable as his previous apprentice.

            I don't know why these things have to be transmitted by word of mouth, he thought.

            and this kind of life cannot be captured in pictures or words.

            The boy couldn't believe what he was seeing:
            the oasis, rather than being just a well surrounded by a few palm trees —
            as he had seen once in a geography book —
            was much larger than many towns back in Spain.
            There were three hundred wells, fifty thousand date trees, and innumerable colored tents spread among them.

            They were surrounded by children, curious to look at the animals and people that were arriving.
            The men of the oasis wanted to know if they had seen any fighting,
            and the women competed with one another for access to the cloth and precious stones brought by the merchants.
            The silence of the desert was a distant dream;
            the travelers in the caravan were talking incessantly, laughing and shouting,
            as if they had emerged from the spiritual world and found themselves once again in the world of people.
            They were relieved and happy.

            They had been taking careful precautions in the desert,
            but the camel driver explained to the boy that oases were always considered to be neutral territories,
            because the majority of the inhabitants were women and children.
            There were oases throughout the desert, but the tribesmen fought in the desert,
            leaving the oases as places of refuge.

            With some difficulty, the leader of the caravan brought all his people together and gave them his instructions.
            The group was to remain there at the oasis until the conflict between the tribes was over.
            Since they were visitors, they would have to share living space with those who lived there,
            and would be given the best accommodations.
            That was the law of hospitality.
            Then he asked that everyone, including his own sentinels, hand over their arms to the men appointed by the tribal chieftains.

            "Those are the rules of war," the leader explained. "The oases may not shelter armies or troops."

        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            To the boy's surprise, the Englishman took a chrome-plated revolver out of his bag and gave it to the men who were collecting the arms.

            Meanwhile, the boy thought about his treasure.
            The closer he got to the realization of his dream, the more difficult things became.
            It seemed as if what the old king had called "beginner's luck" were no longer functioning.
            In his pursuit of the dream, he was being constantly subjected to tests of his persistence and courage.
            So he could not be hasty, nor impatient.
            If he pushed forward impulsively, he would fail to see the signs and omens left by God along his path.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>

        <p class="indented">
            God placed them along my path. He had surprised himself with the thought.
            Until then, he had considered the omens to be things of this world.
            Like eating or sleeping, or like seeking love or finding a job.
            He had never thought of them in terms of a language used by God to indicate what he should do.

        <p class="indented">
            "Don't be impatient," he repeated to himself.
            "It's like the camel driver said: Eat when it's time to eat. And move along when it's time to move along.'"

        <p class="indented">
            That first day, everyone slept from exhaustion, including the Englishman.
            The boy was assigned a place far from his friend, in a tent with five other young men of about his age.
            They were people of the desert, and clamored to hear his stories about the great cities.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            The boy told them about his life as a shepherd,
            and was about to tell them of his experiences at the crystal shop when the Englishman came into the tent.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            "I've been looking for you all morning," he said, as he led the boy outside.
            "I need you to help me find out where the alchemist lives."
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            First, they tried to find him on their own.
            An alchemist would probably live in a manner that was different from that of the rest of the people at the oasis,
            and it was likely that in his tent an oven was continuously burning.
            They searched everywhere, and found that the oasis was much larger than they could have imagined; there were hundreds of tents.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            "We've wasted almost the entire day," said the Englishman, sitting down with the boy near one of the wells.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            "Maybe we'd better ask someone," the boy suggested.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            The Englishman didn't want to tell others about his reasons for being at the oasis, and couldn't make up his mind.
            But, finally, he agreed that the boy, who spoke better Arabic than he, should do so.
            The boy approached a woman who had come to the well to fill a goatskin with water.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            "Good afternoon, ma'am. I'm trying to find out where the alchemist lives here at the oasis."
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            The woman said she had never heard of such a person, and hurried away.
            But before she fled, she advised the boy that he had better not try to converse with women who were dressed in black,
            because they were married women. He should respect tradition.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            The Englishman was disappointed.
            It seemed he had made the long journey for nothing.
            The boy was also saddened; his friend was in pursuit of his destiny.
            And, when someone was in such pursuit, the entire universe made an effort to help him succeed — that's what the old king had said.
            He couldn't have been wrong.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            "I had never heard of alchemists before," the boy said. "Maybe no one here has, either."
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            The Englishman's eyes lit up.
            "That's it! Maybe no one here knows what an alchemist is! Find out who it is who cures the people's illnesses!"
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            Several women dressed in black came to the well for water,
            but the boy would speak to none of them,
            despite the Englishman's insistence. Then a man approached.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            "Do you know someone here who cures people's illnesses?" the boy asked.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            "Allah cures our illnesses," said the man, clearly frightened of the strangers.
            "You're looking for witch doctors." He spoke some verses from the Koran, and moved on.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            Another man appeared. He was older, and was carrying a small bucket. The boy repeated his question.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            "Why do you want to find that sort of person?" the Arab asked.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            "Because my friend here has traveled for many months in order to meet with him," the boy said.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            "If such a man is here at the oasis, he must be the very powerful one,"
            said the old man after thinking for a few moments.
            "Not even the tribal chieftains are able to see him when they want to. Only when he consents.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>

        <p class="indented">
            "Wait for the end of the war. Then leave with the caravan.
            Don't try to enter into the life of the oasis," he said, and walked away.

        <p class="indented">
            But the Englishman was exultant. They were on the right track.

        <p class="indented">
            Finally, a young woman approached who was not dressed in black.
            She had a vessel on her shoulder, and her head was covered by a veil, but her face was uncovered.
            The boy approached her to ask about the alchemist.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            At that moment, it seemed to him that time stood still, and the Soul of the World surged within him.
            When he looked into her dark eyes, and saw that her lips were poised between a laugh and silence,
            he learned the most important part of the language that all the world spoke —
            the language that everyone on earth was capable of understanding in their heart.
            It was love. Something older than humanity, more ancient than the desert.
            Something that exerted the same force whenever two pairs of eyes met, as had theirs here at the well.
            She smiled, and that was certainly an omen — the omen he had been awaiting, without even knowing he was, for all his life.
            The omen he had sought to find with his sheep and in his books, in the crystals and in the silence of the desert.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            It was the pure Language of the World.
            It required no explanation, just as the universe needs none as it travels through endless time.
            What the boy felt at that moment was that he was in the presence of the only woman in his life,
            and that, with no need for words, she recognized the same thing.
            He was more certain of it than of anything in the world.
            He had been told by his parents and grandparents that he must fall in love and really know a person before becoming committed.
            But maybe people who felt that way had never learned the universal language.
            Because, <span class="text-key-point">when you know that language, it's easy to understand that someone in the world awaits you,
                whether it's in the middle of the desert or in some great city.</span>
            And when two such people encounter each other, and their eyes meet, the past and the future become unimportant.
            There is only that moment, and the incredible certainty that everything under the sun has been written by one hand only.
            It is the hand that evokes love, and creates a twin soul for every person in the world.
            Without such love, one's dreams would have no meaning.

            The Englishman vanished, too, gone to find the alchemist.

            He wandered for a while, keeping the date palms of the oasis within sight.
            He listened to the wind, and felt the stones beneath his feet.
            Here and there, he found a shell, and realized that the desert, in remote times, had been a sea.
            He sat on a stone, and allowed himself to become hypnotized by the horizon.
            He tried to deal with the concept of love as distinct from possession, and couldn't separate them.

            It was just that he couldn't grasp what it meant.
            He followed the movement of the birds, trying to read something into it.
            Maybe these desert birds could explain to him the meaning of love without ownership.

            The vision vanished immediately, but it had shaken him.
            He had heard people speak of mirages, and had already seen some himself:
            <span class="text-key-point">they were desires that, because of their intensity, materialized over the sands of the desert.</span>

            The desert was full of men who earned their living based on the ease with which they could penetrate to the Soul of the World.
            They were known as seers, and they were held in fear by women and the elderly.
            Tribesmen were also wary of consulting them,
            because it would be impossible to be effective in battle if one knew that he was fated to die.
            The tribesmen preferred the taste of battle, and the thrill of not knowing what the outcome would be;
            the future was already written by Allah, and what he had written was always for the good of man.
            So the tribesmen lived only for the present, because the present was full of surprises,
            and they had to be aware of many things: Where was the enemy's sword?
            Where was his horse? What kind of blow should one deliver next in order to remain alive?
            The camel driver was not a fighter, and he had consulted with seers.
            Many of them had been right about what they said, while some had been wrong.
            Then, one day, the oldest seer he had ever sought out (and the one most to be feared)
            had asked why the camel driver was so interested in the future.

            Only the lights in the great tent remained.

            The ground was covered with the most beautiful carpets he had ever walked upon,
            and from the top of the structure hung lamps of hand- wrought gold, each with a lighted candle.
            The tribal chieftains were seated at the back of the tent in a semicircle, resting upon richly embroidered silk cushions.
            Servants came and went with silver trays laden with spices and tea.

            The men fell into an animated discussion.
            They spoke in an Arabic dialect that the boy didn't understand, but, when he made to leave, the guard told him to stay.
            The boy became fearful; the omens told him that something was wrong.
            He regretted having spoken to the camel driver about what he had seen in the desert.

            The man hadn't participated in the discussion, and, in fact, hadn't said a word up to that point.
            But the boy was already used to the Language of the World, and he could feel the vibrations of peace throughout the tent.

            The discussion ended.
            The chieftains were silent for a few moments as they listened to what the old man was saying.
            Then he turned to the boy: this time his expression was cold and distant.

            "Two thousand years ago, in a distant land, a man who believed in dreams was thrown into a dungeon and then sold as a slave," the old man said,
            now in the dialect the boy understood.
            "Our merchants bought that man, and brought him to Egypt.
            All of us know that whoever believes in dreams also knows how to interpret them."

            The elder continued, "When the pharaoh dreamed of cows that were thin and cows that were fat,
            this man I'm speaking of rescued Egypt from famine. His name was Joseph.
            He, too, was a stranger in a strange land, like you, and he was probably about your age."

            "We always observe the Tradition.
            The Tradition saved Egypt from famine in those days, and made the Egyptians the wealthiest of peoples.
            The Tradition teaches men how to cross the desert, and how their children should marry.
            The Tradition says that an oasis is neutral territory, because both sides have oases,

            The old man gave a signal, and everyone stood. The meeting was over.
            The hookahs were extinguished, and the guards stood at attention.
            The boy made ready to leave, but the old man spoke again:

        <p class="indented">
            "Tomorrow, we are going to break the agreement that says that no one at the oasis may carry arms.
            Throughout the entire day we will be on the lookout for our enemies.
            When the sun sets, the men will once again surrender their arms to me.
            For every ten dead men among our enemies, you will receive a piece of gold.

            "But arms cannot be drawn unless they also go into battle.

            When the boy left the tent, the oasis was illuminated only by the light of the full moon.

            He was alarmed by what had happened.
            He had succeeded in reaching through to the Soul of the World, and now the price for having done so might be his life.
            It was a frightening bet.
            But he had been making risky bets ever since the day he had sold his sheep to pursue his destiny.
            And, as the camel driver had said, <span class="text-key-point">to die tomorrow was no worse than dying on any other day.
                Every day was there to be lived or to mark one's departure from this world.

            Walking along in the silence, he had no regrets.
            If he died tomorrow, it would be because God was not willing to change the future.
            He would at least have died after having crossed the strait,
            after having worked in a crystal shop, and after having known the silence of the desert and Fatima's eyes.
            He had lived every one of his days intensely since he had left home so long ago.
            If he died tomorrow, he would already have seen more than other shepherds, and he was proud of that.

            Suddenly he heard a thundering sound, and he was thrown to the ground by a wind such as he had never known.
            The area was swirling in dust so intense that it hid the moon from view.
            Before him was an enormous white horse, rearing over him with a frightening scream.

        <p class="indented">
            When the blinding dust had settled a bit, the boy trembled at what he saw.
            Astride the animal was a horseman dressed completely in black, with a falcon perched on his left shoulder.
            He wore a turban and his entire face, except for his eyes, was covered with a black kerchief.
            He appeared to be a messenger from the desert, but his presence was much more powerful than that of a mere messenger.

            The strange horseman drew an enormous, curved sword from a scabbard mounted on his saddle.
            The steel of its blade glittered in the light of the moon.

            "Who dares to read the meaning of the flight of the hawks?" he demanded,

            "It is I who dared to do so," said the boy.
            He was reminded of the image of Santiago Matamoros, mounted on his white horse, with the infidels beneath his hooves.
            This man looked exactly the same, except that now the roles were reversed.

            The horseman was completely immobile, as was the boy.
            It didn't even occur to the boy to flee.
            In his heart, he felt a strange sense of joy: he was about to die in pursuit of his destiny.
            And for Fatima. The omens had been true, after all.
            Here he was, face-to-face with his enemy, but there was no need to be concerned about dying — the Soul of the World awaited him,
            and he would soon be a part of it.
            And, tomorrow, his enemy would also be apart of that Soul.

            Next morning, there were two thousand armed men scattered throughout the palm trees at Al-Fayoum.
            Before the sun had reached its high point, five hundred tribesmen appeared on the horizon.
            The mounted troops entered the oasis from the north;
            it appeared to be a peaceful expedition, but they all carried arms hidden in their robes.
            When they reached the white tent at the center of Al-Fayoum,

            The children had been kept at the other side of a grove of palm trees, and saw nothing of what had happened.
            The women had remained in their tents, praying for the safekeeping of their husbands, and saw nothing of the battle, either.
            Were it not for the bodies there on the ground, it would have appeared to be a normal day at the oasis.

            The only tribesman spared was the commander of the battalion.
            That afternoon, he was brought before the tribal chieftains, who asked him why he had violated the Tradition.

            The following night, the boy appeared at the alchemist's tent with a horse.
            The alchemist was ready, and
            he mounted his own steed and placed the falcon on his left shoulder.
            He said to the boy, "Show me where there is life out in the desert. Only those who can see such signs of life are able to find treasure."

            He wanted to say so to the alchemist, but he was afraid of the man.

            And then the boy understood.
            He loosened the reins on his horse, who galloped forward over the rocks and sand.
            The alchemist followed as the boy's horse ran for almost half an hour.
            They could no longer see the palms of the oasis — only the gigantic moon above them,
            and its silver reflections from the stones of the desert. Suddenly, for no apparent reason, the boy's horse began to slow.

            They dismounted, and the alchemist said nothing. Advancing slowly, they searched among the stones.
            The alchemist stopped abruptly, and bent to the ground.
            There was a hole there among the stones.
            The alchemist put his hand into the hole, and then his entire arm, up to his shoulder.
            Something was moving there, and the alchemist's eyes — the boy could see only his eyes-squinted with his effort.
            His arm seemed to be battling with whatever was in the hole.
            Then, with a motion that startled the boy, he withdrew his arm and leaped to his feet.
            In his hand, he grasped a snake by the tail.

            The boy leapt as well, but away from the alchemist.
            The snake fought frantically, making hissing sounds that shattered the silence of the desert.
            It was a cobra, whose venom could kill a person in minutes.

            "Watch out for his venom," the boy said.
            But even though the alchemist had put his hand in the hole, and had surely already been bitten, his expression was calm.
            "The alchemist is two hundred years old," the Englishman had told him. He must know how to deal with the snakes of the desert.

            The boy watched as his companion went to his horse and withdrew a scimitar.
            With its blade, he drew a circle in the sand, and then he placed the snake within it.
            The serpent relaxed immediately.

            He could see the Englishman at his experiments, and the camel driver who was a teacher without realizing it.
            Maybe the alchemist has never been in love, the boy thought.

            The alchemist rode in front, with the falcon on his shoulder.
            The bird knew the language of the desert well, and whenever they stopped, he flew off in search of game.
            On the first day he returned with a rabbit, and on the second with two birds.

            The desert nights were cold, and were becoming darker and darker as the phases of the moon passed.
            They went on for a week, speaking only of the precautions they needed to follow in order to avoid the battles between the tribes.
            The war continued, and at times the wind carried the sweet, sickly smell of blood.
            Battles had been fought nearby, and the wind reminded the boy that there was the language of omens,
            always ready to show him what his eyes had failed to observe.

            His heart beat fastest when it spoke to the boy of treasure,

            The boy's heart began to speak of fear.
            It told him stories it had heard from the Soul of the World, stories of men who sought to find their treasure and never succeeded.
            Sometimes it frightened the boy with the idea that he might not find his treasure, or that he might die there in the desert.

            He lost his fear, and forgot about his need to go back to the oasis,

            It said that all people who are happy have God within them.
            And that happiness could be found in a grain of sand from the desert, as the alchemist had said.
            Because a grain of sand is a moment of creation, and the universe has taken millions of years to create it.
            "<span class="text-key-point">Everyone on earth has a treasure that awaits him</span>," his heart said.
            "We, people's hearts, seldom say much about those treasures, because people no longer want to go in search of them.

            They continued across the desert.
            With every day that passed, the boy's heart became more and more silent.
            It no longer wanted to know about things of the past or future;
            it was content simply to contemplate the desert, and to drink with the boy from the Soul of the World.
            The boy and his heart had become friends, and neither was capable now of betraying the other.

            When his heart spoke to him, it was to provide a stimulus to the boy, and to give him strength,
            because the days of silence there in the desert were wearisome.
            His heart told the boy what his strongest qualities were:
            his courage in having given up his sheep and in trying to live out his destiny,
            and his enthusiasm during the time he had worked at the crystal shop.

            it told the boy of dangers that had threatened him, but that he had never perceived.
            His heart said that one time it had hidden the rifle the boy had taken from his father,
            because of the possibility that the boy might wound himself.
            And it reminded the boy of the day when he had been ill and vomiting out in the fields,
            after which he had fallen into a deep sleep.
            There had been two thieves farther ahead who were planning to steal the boy's sheep and murder him.
            But, since the boy hadn't passed by, they had decided to move on, thinking that he had changed his route.

            One afternoon, they passed by the encampment of one of the tribes.
            At each corner of the camp were Arabs garbed in beautiful white robes, with arms at the ready.
            The men were smoking their hookahs and trading stories from the battlefield.
            No one paid any attention to the two travelers.

            That's true, the boy thought.
            He had noticed that, in the midst of the multitude of armed men back at the encampment,

            He had been so far away that his face wasn't even visible.

            The sentinels allowed him to go;
            they had already heard about the sorcerer who could turn himself into the wind,

            The boy looked out at the horizon. There were mountains in the distance.
            And there were dunes, rocks, and plants that insisted on living where survival seemed impossible.
            There was the desert that he had wandered for so many months; despite all that time, he knew only a small part of it.
            Within that small part, he had found an Englishman, caravans, tribal wars,
            and an oasis with fifty thousand palm trees and three hundred wells.

            "The falcon's beak carries bits of me, myself," the desert said.
            "For years, I care for his game, feeding it with the little water that I have, and then I show him where the game is.
            And, one day, as I enjoy the fact that his game thrives on my surface,
            the falcon dives out of the sky, and takes away what I've created."

            "To nourish the falcon. And the falcon then nourishes man.
            And, eventually, man will nourish your sands, where the game will once again flourish. That's how the world goes."

        <p class="indented">
            "Yes, that's what love is.

            The wind has many names.
            In that part of the world, it was called the sirocco, because it brought moisture from the oceans to the east.
            In the distant land the boy came from, they called it the levanter,
            because they believed that it brought with it the sands of the desert,
            and the screams of the Moorish wars.
            Perhaps, in the places beyond the pastures where his sheep lived, men thought that the wind came from Andalusia.
            But, actually, the wind came from no place at all, nor did it go to any place;
            that's why it was stronger than the desert.
            Someone might one day plant trees in the desert, and even raise sheep there, but never would they harness the wind.

            The wind's curiosity was aroused, something that had never happened before.
            It wanted to talk about those things, but it didn't know how to turn a man into the wind.
            And look how many things the wind already knew how to do!
            It created deserts, sank ships, felled entire forests, and blew through cities filled with music and strange noises.
            It felt that it had no limits, yet here was a boy saying that there were other things the wind should be able to do.

            "This is what we call love," the boy said, seeing that the wind was close to granting what he requested.
            "When you are loved, you can do anything in creation.
            When you are loved, there's no need at all to understand what's happening,
            because everything happens within you, and even men can turn themselves into the wind.

            The wind was a proud being, and it was becoming irritated with what the boy was saying.
            It commenced to blow harder, raising the desert sands.
            But finally it had to recognize that, even making its way around the world,
            it didn't know how to turn a man into the wind. And it knew nothing about love.

            "In my travels around the world, I've often seen people speaking of love and looking toward the heavens," the wind said,

            From where I am — and I'm a long way from the earth — I learned how to love.
            I know that if I came even a little bit closer to the earth,
            everything there would die, and the Soul of the World would no longer exist.
            So we contemplate each other, and we want each other, and I give it life and warmth, and it gives me my reason for living."

            A current of love rushed from his heart, and the boy began to pray.
            It was a prayer that he had never said before, because it was a prayer without words or pleas.
            His prayer didn't give thanks for his sheep having found new pastures;
            it didn't ask that the boy be able to sell more crystal;
            and it didn't beseech that the woman he had met continue to await his return.
            In the silence, the boy understood that the desert,
            the wind, and the sun were also trying to understand the signs written by the hand,
            and were seeking to follow their paths, and to understand what had been written on a single emerald.
            He saw that omens were scattered throughout the earth and in space,
            and that there was no reason or significance attached to their appearance;
            he could see that not the deserts, nor the winds, nor the sun, nor people knew why they had been created.
            But that the hand had a reason for all of this, and that only the hand could perform miracles,
            or transform the sea into a desert. . . or a man into the wind.
            Because only the hand understood that it was a larger design that had moved the universe to the point
            at which six days of creation had evolved into a Master Work.

            When the lead had become liquid, the alchemist took from his pouch the strange yellow egg.

            He was just and good. One afternoon, one of his servants fell ill, and it appeared that he would die.
            Your son had heard of a rabbi who was able to cure illnesses, and he rode out for days and days in search of this man.
            Along the way, he learned that the man he was seeking was the Son of God.
            He met others who had been cured by him, and they instructed your son in the man's teachings.
            And so, despite the fact that he was a Roman centurion, he converted to their faith.
            Shortly thereafter, he reached the place where the man he was looking for was visiting.'

        <p class="indented">
            The boy rode along through the desert for several hours, listening avidly to what his heart had to say.
            It was his heart that would tell him where his treasure was hidden.

            But his heart was speaking of other things.
            With pride, it told the story of a shepherd who had left his flock to follow a dream he had on two different occasions.
            It told of destiny, and of the many men who had wandered in search of distant lands or beautiful women,
            confronting the people of their times with their preconceived notions.
            It spoke of journeys, discoveries, books, and change.

        <p class="indented">
            As he was about to climb yet another dune, his heart whispered,
            "Be aware of the place where you are brought to tears. That's where I am, and that's where your treasure is."
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：你落类的地方，就是你心愿所在，就是你的宝藏所在。</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            The boy climbed the dune slowly.
            A full moon rose again in the starry sky: it had been a month since he had set forth from the oasis.
            The moonlight cast shadows through the dunes, creating the appearance of a rolling sea;
            it reminded the boy of the day when that horse had reared in the desert,
            and he had come to know the alchemist.
            And the moon fell on the desert's silence, and on a man's journey in search of treasure.

        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            When he reached the top of the dune, his heart leapt.
            There, illuminated by the light of the moon and the brightness of the desert, stood the solemn and majestic Pyramids of Egypt.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            The boy fell to his knees and wept.
            He thanked God for making him believe in his destiny,
            and for leading him to meet a king, a merchant, an Englishman, and an alchemist.
            And above all for his having met a woman of the desert who had told him that <span class="text-key-point">love would never keep a man from his destiny.</span>

            If he wanted to, he could now return to the oasis, go back to Fatima, and live his life as a simple shepherd.
            After all, the alchemist continued to live in the desert, even though he understood the Language of the World,
            and knew how to transform lead into gold.
            He didn't need to demonstrate his science and art to anyone.
            The boy told himself that, on the way toward realizing his own destiny,
            he had learned all he needed to know, and had experienced everything he might have dreamed of.

            But here he was, at the point of finding his treasure,
            and he reminded himself that no project is completed until its objective has been achieved.
            The boy looked at the sands around him, and saw that,
            where his tears had fallen, a scarab beetle was scuttling through the sand.
            During his time in the desert, he had learned that, in Egypt, the scarab beetles are a symbol of God.

        <p class="indented">
            Another omen! The boy began to dig into the dune.
            As he did so, he thought of what the crystal merchant had once said: that anyone could build a pyramid in his backyard.
            The boy could see now that he couldn't do so if he placed stone upon stone for the rest of his life.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            Throughout the night, the boy dug at the place he had chosen, but found nothing.
            He felt weighted down by the centuries of time since the Pyramids had been built.
            But he didn't stop. He struggled to continue digging as he fought the wind, which often blew the sand back into the excavation.
            His hands were abraded and exhausted, but he listened to his heart.
            It had told him to dig where his tears fell.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            As he was attempting to pull out the rocks he encountered, he heard footsteps.
            Several figures approached him. Their backs were to the moonlight, and the boy could see neither their eyes nor their faces.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            "What are you doing here?" one of the figures demanded.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            Because he was terrified, the boy didn't answer.
            He had found where his treasure was, and was frightened at what might happen.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            "We're refugees from the tribal wars, and we need money," the other figure said. "What are you hiding there?"
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            "I'm not hiding anything," the boy answered.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            But one of them seized the boy and yanked him back out of the hole.
            Another, who was searching the boy's bags, found the piece of gold.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>

        <p class="indented">
            The moon shone on the face of the Arab who had seized him, and in the man's eyes the boy saw death.

        <p class="indented">
            They made the boy continue digging, but he found nothing.
            As the sun rose, the men began to beat the boy.
            He was bruised and bleeding, his clothing was torn to shreds, and he felt that death was near.

        <p class="indented">
            "What good is money to you if you're going to die? It's not often that money can save someone's life," the alchemist had said.
            Finally, the boy screamed at the men, "I'm digging for treasure!"
            And, although his mouth was bleeding and swollen,
            he told his attackers that he had twice dreamed of a treasure hidden near the Pyramids of Egypt.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>

        <p class="indented">
            The man who appeared to be the leader of the group spoke to one of the others:
            "Leave him. He doesn't have anything else. He must have stolen this gold."
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            The boy fell to the sand, nearly unconscious. The leader shook him and said, "We're leaving."
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            But before they left, he came back to the boy and said,
            "You're not going to die. You'll live, and you'll learn that a man shouldn't be so stupid.
            Two years ago, right here on this spot, I had a recurrent dream, too.
            I dreamed that I should travel to the fields of Spain and look for a ruined church where shepherds and their sheep slept.
            In my dream, there was a sycamore growing out of the ruins of the sacristy,
            and I was told that, if I dug at the roots of the sycamore, I would find a hidden treasure.
            But I'm not so stupid as to cross an entire desert just because of a recurrent dream."
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            And they disappeared.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            The boy stood up shakily, and looked once more at the Pyramids.
            They seemed to laugh at him, and he laughed back, his heart bursting with joy.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            Because now he knew where his treasure was.
