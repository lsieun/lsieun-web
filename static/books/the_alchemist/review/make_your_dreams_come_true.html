            Three Most Powerful Paulo Coelho Quotes
        </p>
        <div class="w3-panel w3-pale-yellow w3-topbar w3-bottombar w3-border-yellow">
            <p>Quote#1:</p>
            <p>
                There is ONE GREAT TRUTH on this planet:
                Whoever you are, or whatever it is that you do, when you want something,
                it is because that desire originated in the soul of the Universe.
                It is your mission on earth.
            </p>
            <p>Quote#2:</p>
            <p>
                The soul of the Universe nourished by people's happiness.
            </p>
            <p>Quote#3:</p>
            <p>
                To realize one's destiny is a person's only real obligation.
                All things are one.
                When you want something; all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p class="indented">
            You must have read all these three quotes and probably fallen in love with the third one “when you want something,
            all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.”
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            But in spite of knowing this quote and desiring many things you still couldn't get what you want.
            What is the reason the Universe doesn't conspire for you to achieve your dreams?
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            The secret to this most famous quote stored in the other two quotes.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            The first quote says “your desire originates in the soul of the Universe”
            and that's why the Universe conspires in helping you achieve it.
            So when the Universe conspires for your dreams,
            it works for making the desire within the soul of the Universe come true.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            It means your desire and the desire of the Soul of The Universe is the same.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            <span class="text-key-point">But why the universe couldn't make the desire come true when it originates in its soul,
                and it supposed to get manifested through you.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            Read the second quote “The soul of the Universe nourished by people's happiness.”
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            So if you desire something with happiness and if you find joy working on that dream,
            then you nourished the soul of the Universe.
            <span class="text-key-point">When you nourished the soul of the Universe for that particular desire,
                the whole universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            If any of your dreams are not coming true whether it is about love, relationship, job, money, health or simply well-being, the reason is this only.
            <span class="text-key-point">You are not nourishing the soul of the Universe with your happiness.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            No matter how badly you want something but if you want it with desperation,
            if you want it because you feel sad without it then you won't get it.
            If you want something with the feelings of anger or sadness or frustration,
            then the Universe can't make it true for you.
            Because with all these negative feelings, you are weakening the soul of the Universe and making the desire die within it.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            I believe now you have clearly understood these three powerful Paulo Coelho Quotes, and it's secret.
            If you keep these three quotes in your mind and work on your dreams, happily the Universe will conspire in making you achieve it.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            Honestly, it is not possible for everyone to feel happy about their dreams all the time.
            There may be moments of sadness or challenges.
            But knowing the secret of the Universe makes you aware that what you are doing wrong.
        </p>
        <p class="indented text-key-point">
            Feeling sad or negative from time to time is normal.
            We are human, and the greatest gift of being human is that we have a mind to choose the right thoughts and actions.
            We have the gift of consciousness to change our focus from negativity to positivity and from sadness to happiness.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            When you remember this secret of the Universe and use your gift of consciousness, you will manifest everything you want.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            As Albert Schweitzer has said:

            <p>
                Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success.
