                    <p> My primary goal in writing this book was to explain the Java Virtual Machine, and the software
                        technologies upon which it is based, to Java programmers. Although the Java Virtual Machine
                        incorporates technologies that had been tried and proven in other programming languages, prior
                        to Java many of these technologies had not yet entered into common use. As a consequence, many
                        programmers will be encountering these technologies for the first time as they begin to program
                        in Java. Garbage collection, multi-threading , exception handling, dynamic extension--even the
                        use of a virtual machine itself--may be new to many programmers. The aim of this book is to help
                        programmers understand how all these things work, and in the process, to help them become more
                        adept with the Java programming language. </p>
                    <p> Another goal I had in mind as I wrote this book was to experiment a bit with the changing nature
                        of text. Web pages have three interesting characteristics that differentiate them from
                        paper-based text: they're dynamic (they can evolve over time), they're interactive (
                        especially if you embed Java applets in them), and they're interconnected (you can easily
                        navigate from one to another). Besides the traditional text and figures, this book includes
                        several Java applets (in a mini-website on the CD-ROM) that serve as "interactive illustrations"
                        of the concepts presented in the text. In addition, I maintain a website on the internet that
                        serves as a launching point for readers to find more (and more current) information on the
                        topics covered in the book. This book is composed of all of these components : text, figures,
                        interactive illustrations, and constantly evolving links to further reading. </p>
