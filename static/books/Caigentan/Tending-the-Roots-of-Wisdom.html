            Those who preserve their moral integrity suffer only fleeting loneliness.<br/>
            But eternal wretchedness awaits those who toady to the powerful.<br/>
            Wise men fix their gaze on spiritual cultivation, which transcends material things.<br/>
            They wish to leave a good name after them, and choosing fleeting loneliness over eternal wretchedness.<br/>

            A man with only slight experience of the world will likewise be only slightly stained with its impurities.<br/>
            A man well versed in the ways of the world will likewise be replete with its tricks and treacheries.<br/>
            Therefore, it is better for the upright man to preserve the plainness of his inborn nature than to take pains to acquire worldly wisdom.<br/>
            It is also better for him to remain uninhibited and straightforward than to be equivocal and compromising.

            The heart of a real gentleman is as clear as the blue sky and the broad daylight,<br/>
            so that others may never misunderstand it.<br/>
            But he seldom reveals his talents, which are like a jade hidden in a jadestone.

        <hr/>

        <p>
            A person who shuns power, wealth and luxury is clean.<br/>
            But a man who comes into contact with power, wealth and luxury and still remains unsullied is even cleaner.<br/>
            He who is unacquainted with wiles and intrigues is noble.<br/>
            But a person who is acquainted with wiles and intrigues but scorns to use them is even nobler.
        </p>
        <hr/>

        <p>
            The frequent hearing of what we do not want to hear,<br/>
            and the frequent pondering of what troubles the mind act like a whetstone<br/>
            upon which we refine our nature and conduct.<br/>
            If everything we hear is pleasant to the ear,<br/>
            and everything we contemplate is pleasant to the mind,<br/>
            that is no different from steeping our lives in poisoned wine.

            When the wind rages and the rain beats down, even the birds seem woebegone.<br/>
            But when the rain ceases to pelt and the wind subsides, the very grass and trees bloom luxuriantly in the fresh sunshine.<br/>
            So, if the world cannot do without a period of sanctified peace during a day's time,<br/>
            then men can definitely not tolerate a single day with their hearts totally bereft of joy.

            Real flavour does not lie in refined liquors or sumptuous dishes;<br/>
            only plain food gives forth a pure taste.<br/>
            The man who has attained the realm of perfect virtue<br/>
            is not the wonder maker who stands out from all his fellows.<br/>
            He is found among the run-of-the-mill.

        <p>
            Although the Universe seems to be at rest, its components are constantly in motion.<br/>
            The sun and moon whirl night and day, and cast ceaseless and eternal beams.<br/>
            Likewise, a man of noble character must keep himself alert while unoccupied, and enjoy repose while exerting himself.
        </p>
        <hr/>

        <p>
            In the still of the night, when a man sits alone in meditation,<br/>
            the first thing that happens is that his inordinate desires disappear, and his true self holds sway.<br/>
            Every time this occurs, he enjoys a spontaneous pleasure that comes from within himself.<br/>
            But if, after finding his true self, he feels he cannot cast aside erroneous thoughts, great shame comes upon him.
        </p>

        <p>
            A favour received inevitably brings harm in its wake.<br/>
            When you feel gratified, stop forging ahead, and turn round promptly.<br/>
            It is equally true that accomplishment may follow defeat.<br/>
            Therefore, do not give up halfway when feeling terribly upset.
        </p>
        <hr/>

        <p>
            People who take coarse food and drink usually have morals as clean as ice and as pure as jade.<br/>
            Those, on the other hand, who set great store by fine garments and tasty fare tend to be servile flatterers and willing slaves.<br/>
            A man’s aspirations can only shine forth from purity of heart and paucity of desires,<br/>
            whereas his moral integrity can be easily forfeited through indulging in creature comforts.
        </p>
        <hr/>

        <p>
            In dealing with other people, a person must be broad-minded and tolerant,<br/>
            so as not to make them sigh with resentment.<br/>
            Then after his death his bountiful deeds will live on,<br/>
            earning people's boundless gratitude.
        </p>
        <hr/>

        <p>
            On a narrow path, step aside one pace so that others may pass.<br/>
            When treated to fine food, offer some of it to your fellow diners.<br/>
            Such a manner of behaving in society will best ensure a person peace and happiness.

        <hr/>

        <p>
            To live as a true man, you do not need extraordinary accomplishments;<br/>
            all you need to do is to free yourself from vulgar distractions,<br/>
            and then you can join the ranks of eminent personages.<br/>
            To pursue study, you do not need any special formula for success;<br/>
            all you need to do is to get rid of desires for material comforts<br/>
            that trouble your head, and then you can enter the domain of the sages.
        </p>
        <hr/>

        <p>
            To make friends with others, you need a strong sense of justice and a readiness to help.<br/>
            To be a true man, you should preserve a pure heart.
        </p>
        <hr/>

        <p>
            Do not scramble for favour and profit; do not lag behind in virtue and accomplishments.<br/>
            In receiving material enjoyments, do not exceed what is fitting for your station in life;<br/>
            in cultivating virtue, do not lower your standards.
        </p>
        <hr/>

        <p>
            When conducting yourself in society, it is wise to be ready to make concessions.<br/>
            To retreat a pace is to make good preparation for a later advance.<br/>
            To treat others with kindness is part of your own happiness,<br/>
            for by benefiting others you lay the foundation for your own future benefit.
        </p>
        <hr/>

        <p>
            No matter how earth-shaking one's achievements, self-conceit will cancel them out.<br/>
            No matter how horrendous one's sins, repentance will atone for them.
        </p>
        <hr/>

        <p>
            When your good reputation goes hand in hand with your high morals,<br/>
            you should not treat these achievements exclusively as your own,<br/>
            but share them with others.<br/>
            That way you preserve yourself from distant dangers.<br/>
            Shameful conduct and unsavoury reputation should not be foisted off entirely onto others,<br/>
            but some should be taken on your own shoulders.<br/>
            That way you can hide your capacities and cultivate your virtue.
        </p>
        <hr/>

        <p>
            Whatever I do, I leave some part of it unfinished;<br/>
            that way the Creator will not frown on me and the ghosts and spirits will not be able to harm me.<br/>
            If, in the course of self-cultivation, I strive for seamless perfection,<br/>
            and in the course of earthly achievements I head straight for the summit,<br/>
            even though I incur no internal calamity,<br/>
            I will surely bring upon myself some external grief.
        </p>
        <hr/>

        <p>
            Real faith and genuine rules of conduct can be found in the home and in everyday life.<br/>
            If everyone practised sincerity and harmony, with a smiling countenance and polite words<br/>
            there would be no estrangement between family members whatsoever and<br/>
            their interests would coincide completely.<br/>
            This is ten thousand times better than sitting in meditation or practising breath control.
        </p>
        <hr/>

        <p>
            A man fond of movement is like lightning flashing through the clouds, ephemeral.<br/>
            He flickers like a candle flame in the wind.<br/>
            On the other hand, a man devoted to quietude is like dead ashes or<br/>
            a blighted tree stump, bereft of all vitality.<br/>
            The essence of the Way is found in movement within stillness and stillness within movement.<br/>
            Movement and rest must complement each other,<br/>
            like hawks flitting through stationary clouds or fish leaping in the still waters of a pond.
        </p>
        <hr/>

        <p>
            When censuring someone for his faults, do not be too severe;<br/>
            consider the other’s level of tolerance.<br/>
            When teaching a man correct conduct,<br/>
            do not set goals which are too lofty for him to reach;<br/>
            consider what he is capable of accomplishing.
        </p>

        <p>
            Nothing is filthier than the dung beetle,<br/>
            yet in one morning it can turn into a cicada and drink the pure autumn dew.<br/>
            Rotten grass has no lustre, yet in one morning it can give birth to the glowworm,<br/>
            which gives out brilliant flashes of light on summer nights.<br/>
            From this we can know that pure things can emerge from filthy places and<br/>
            brightness is often a product of darkness.
        </p>
        <hr/>

        <p>
            Self-conceit and arrogance are the result of evil influences from outside oneself.<br/>
            Such influences must be suppressed; only then can healthy trends be encouraged.<br/>
            All one's carnal desires and other distractions come from a twisted mind;<br/>
            only by getting rid of such mental distortions can one's true nature be realized.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you muse on the flavour of food after you have eaten your fill,<br/>
            the feeling of relishing different flavours vanishes.<br/>
            If you ponder the pleasures of the flesh after satisfying your carnal appetites,<br/>
            then the scene of naked lovemaking disappears.<br/>
            Therefore, if you can use the remorse of hindsight to dispel future foolish obsessions,<br/>
            you can make your nature as steady as a rock and<br/>
            your behaviour will always be on the right track.

            The great officers of the court must foster in themselves a bit of<br/>
            the mindset of the hermit who lives in the mountains and forests.<br/>
            At the same time, the recluse must never abandon the ambition and ability to serve his country.
        </p>
        <hr/>

        <p>
            In conducting yourself, do not expect to accomplish the greatest things;<br/>
            so long as you do not make mistakes, you make achievements.<br/>
            When treating others with kindness, do not expect gratitude in return;<br/>
            so long as you do not cause resentment, that is gratitude enough.
        </p>
        <hr/>

        <p>
            Exerting yourself to do a good job is a fine moral trait.<br/>
            But if you make yourself too miserable in the process,<br/>
            then your own ease of mind becomes impossible.<br/>
            Indifference to wealth and power is a noble quality.<br/>
            But if you are a bit too passive,<br/>
            then you will not be able to assist people or to benefit society.
        </p>
        <hr/>

        <p>
            When judging a person who has encountered misfortune and hardships,<br/>
            it is necessary to understand the aspirations and ambitions he set out with.<br/>
            When judging a person who has achieved success,<br/>
            it is necessary to examine whether he maintains his moral integrity in his old age.
        </p>
        <hr/>

        <p>
            A person of riches and rank should be magnanimous, and never be envious or stingy.<br/>
            Otherwise he would be acting like a mean person,<br/>
            and how then could he really enjoy his riches?<br/>
            By the same token, a person of learning should keep his talents concealed.<br/>
            If he makes a dazzling show of them, then he will be acting like a fool.<br/>
            How could he not come to grief?
        </p>
        <hr/>

        <p>
            You can only think of the danger of ascending to a high place after you have stood in a low place.<br/>
            It is only when you have experienced darkness that you realize how brightness can dazzle the eyes.<br/>
            After cultivating tranquillity, you then know how those who are fond of movement toil.<br/>
            Only a person who has fostered the art of taciturnity knows how annoying a babbler can be.
        </p>
        <hr/>

        <p>
            By casting out thoughts of wealth and rank from his heart,<br/>
            a man rids himself of the taint of the world.<br/>
            By removing the strictures of worldly virtue and morality from his heart,<br/>
            a man can enter the sublime realm of perfect beauty.
        </p>
        <hr/>

        <p>
            Desire for fame and wealth does not necessarily harm the heart of a man with a true nature;<br/>
            it is the clinging to prejudice that is the root of harm to such a nature.<br/>
            Lasciviousness in itself does not necessarily prevent a man cultivating the Way;<br/>
            it is the employment of his intelligence that puts a barrier between him and the Way.

        <hr/>

        <p>
            Human relationships are fickle and the road of life is full of ups and downs.<br/>
            When you meet an impasse, you should understand how to retire one step.<br/>
            When you come to an open road, you should know how to make way for others.

        <p>
            In dealing with mean people, the difficulty lies not in being too strict;<br/>
            but in avoiding a fastidious attitude.<br/>
            In dealing with noble-spirited people,<br/>
            the difficulty lies not in being deferential, but in observing the proprieties.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is better to preserve the innate simplicity of one’s nature and eschew sophistication,<br/>
            thereby leave a spirit of uprightness in the world.<br/>
            Likewise, it is better to turn one’s back on luxurious living and<br/>
            take delight in the plain and pristine,<br/>
            and thereby leave a fine name to the world.

            To conquer the demons, you must first conquer the perversity in your own heart.<br/>
            Once you have done that, the demons will cower and be at your command.<br/>
            To rein in reckless tendencies,<br/>
            you must first control the impulses that lead to such tendencies.<br/>
            Once your heart is tranquil and your life force harmonious,<br/>
            elements from outside will no longer be able to disturb you.

            Instructing one's juniors is like bringing up maidens:<br/>
            The most important thing is to teach them to be circumspect in making friends outside the home.<br/>
            Coming into contact with a bad person is like sowing a bad seed on good farmland —<br/>
            the whole crop will eventually be spoiled.

        <p>
            When you have material gains to pursue,<br/>
            do not make hasty decisions to do so simply because of their easy accessibility.<br/>
            If you do, you will stumble into a deep pit out of which you will not be able to get out.<br/>
            When you seek the truth, do not make even the slightest retreat<br/>
            from any difficulties which the process may entail.<br/>
            If you do, you will find that you are separated from<br/>
            the object of your quest by a thousand mountains.

        <p>
            A man whose thoughts are magnanimous treats both himself and others with consideration.<br/>
            Then magnanimity is everywhere.<br/>
            A man whose thoughts are mean treats both himself and others meanly.<br/>
            Then meanness is everywhere.<br/>
            Therefore, in pursuing his hobbies,<br/>
            a man of noble character should avoid passion as well as indifference.

            Others have riches; I have a spirit of benevolence.<br/>
            Others have high rank; I have a sense of righteousness.<br/>
            A man of virtue should avoid the fetters of high rank and substantial emolument.<br/>
            Since man can prevail over Nature, with a firm will and devotion,<br/>
            a man of virtue can certainly build up his strength and<br/>
            refuse to be moulded by the forces that created the Universe.

            Striving to get on in the world without keeping some distance from it<br/>
            is like trying to shake the dirt off your clothes while shrouded by dust,<br/>
            or like washing your feet in a mud puddle.<br/>
            How can you be free of vulgarities and attain refinement?<br/>
            In your dealings with the world, if you are not good at making concessions<br/>
            you are like a moth flying into a candle flame or a ram caught by the horns in brambles.<br/>
            How can you find peace and contentment?

            A man who pursues learning must collect his scattered thoughts and<br/>
            concentrate all his mental powers on his studies.<br/>
            In the cultivation of virtue, if his aim is simply to gain wealth and fame,<br/>
            then real ethical improvement becomes impossible.<br/>
            In pursuing scholarship, if his interest lies merely in reciting poems and rhymed verses,<br/>
            then a deep understanding of his subject of study becomes impossible.

            Everyone possesses the capacity for great mercy.<br/>
            The saint Vimalakirti and butchers and executioners alike have this capacity.<br/>
            Everywhere in the world can be found the same genuine mood that accords with Nature —<br/>
            be it in a magnificent mansion or a humble cottage.<br/>
            It is just greed that destroys the capacity for great mercy,<br/>
            and fleshly emotions that lock up the genuine mood.<br/>
            Men miss the way to salvation when such an opportunity stares them in the face.<br/>
            A single step in the wrong direction leads them as far from the right path<br/>
            as if a thousand miles intervened.

            Self-cultivation requires a mind impervious to outside allurements,<br/>

            Tempted by profit and fame, one will fall a victim to greed.<br/>
            One who wishes to save his people and benefit his country<br/>
            must have the temperament of a mendicant monk.<br/>
            One who seeks fame and wealth will be surrounded by hidden dangers.

            Not only are the actions and words of a good man peaceful and serene,<br/>
            even when asleep his facial expression is full of good will.<br/>
            As for the bad man, not only are his actions evil and violent,<br/>
            even his speech and voice betray murderous intent.

            When the liver succumbs to disease, the eyes become dim.<br/>
            When the kidneys are disordered, the hearing becomes impaired.<br/>
            Although the root cause of the trouble always lies hidden in an undetected place,<br/>
            the symptoms are invariably there for all to see.<br/>
            Therefore, if a virtuous man does not want his faults manifested in places where all can see them,<br/>
            he must first ensure that there is nothing amiss with him in places hidden from the public.

            No one is happier than he who has caused few troubles.<br/>
            On the other hand, no one invites more trouble than the person who is always suspicious of others.<br/>
            Only a troubled man knows that refraining from causing trouble brings happiness,<br/>
            and only a man with a tranquil mind knows that suspicion brings calamity.

            In an era of peace, one needs to be “square”, which means being strict and upright.<br/>

            When the state is rapidly declining, one needs to be both “square” and “round”.<br/>
            In dealing with good people, one should be tolerant;<br/>

            We should not always keep in mind the good deeds we have done for others.<br/>
            At the same time, we should often reflect on the harm we have done to others.<br/>
            By the same token, we should not forget the favours others have done for us,<br/>
            but should cast to the winds all resentment against others.

            A true benefactor does not regard himself as doing good deeds,<br/>

            A Chinese peck of rice given in such a spirit is worth a granary.<br/>
            But when an alms-giver expects some requital for his largesse,<br/>
            even though he gives away a fortune, it is not worth a copper coin.

            The man of steadfast morals does not pray for happiness,<br/>

            The vicious man is most concerned with escaping calamities,<br/>
            but as he takes steps to do so Heaven deprives him of his senses and leaves him defenceless.<br/>
            From this, we can see that the ingenuity and power of Heaven is unfathomable.<br/>
            What is the use of man’s puny efforts and craftiness?

            If you wish to obtain a moment’s peace and quiet in the midst of noise and clamour,<br/>
            you must master the art of grasping tranquillity beforehand.<br/>
            If you do not make such preparations,<br/>
            then you will always have to change according to circumstances and<br/>
            may get into a panic at any event that takes you by surprise.

            There are two precepts to be followed while serving in public life.<br/>
            The first is that fair judgements can only be made with an impartial mind.<br/>

            In governing a household there are likewise two precepts to be followed.<br/>

            The mountains, the rivers and the land are seen as no more than a tiny speck of dust in the universe,<br/>

            If your own mind is calm and self-composed, and is not driven by impulse to seek fame and fortune,<br/>
            there will be no need to boast that you alone are sober-minded.<br/>

            Lust is as intense and hard to bear as a flame.<br/>
            But when one thinks of how abandoning oneself to lust can bring about illness and suffering,<br/>
            the fire of desire can immediately turn into a heap of cold ashes.<br/>
            Fame and fortune are as enticing as delicious sweets.<br/>
            But when one thinks of how striving for name and gain can result in death,<br/>
            then they at once become tasteless.<br/>
            Therefore, if you constantly bear in mind suffering and death<br/>
            you will eradicate lust and craving for fame and wealth from your heart,<br/>
            and strengthen your desire for enlightenment.

            use the dew dripping from the pine trees to make cinnabar ink with which to underline passages of outstanding wisdom.<br/>
            At noon, standing by the study table expounding on Buddhist Scriptures,<br/>
            tap the jade chimes and let their tinkling be carried far and wide by the wind in the bamboos.

            When a flower is planted in a pot it may wax luxuriant, but in the end it will lack the vitality of natural growth.<br/>
            When a bird is housed in a cage it may sing as before, but its natural exuberance will be decreased.<br/>
            The captive flower and bird will not be like the flowers and birds<br/>
            which mingle freely in the mountains and form that natural tableau which so delights people's hearts.<br/>
            It is the freedom and contentment of the wild bird's soaring flight<br/>
            that enables a person to grasp the zest of Nature.

            The unenlightened man is self-centred,<br/>
            and therefore has many addictions and at the same time many worries.<br/>
            It was said in olden times:<br/>
            "If you don't keep reflecting on your own existence,<br/>
            how can you consider the objects outside you as important?"<br/>
            Again: "If you recognize that your fleshly body is not your real self, how can worries enter your mind?"<br/>
            Really words that hit home.

            When an old man looks back on his youthful days,<br/>
            it is easy for him to banish the desires for fame and gain from his mind.<br/>

            it is easy for him to cast aside all dreams of luxury and opulence.

            In the words of Shao Yong:<br/>
            "What was previously called 'I' has now become 'He'.<br/>
            I wonder who today’s 'I' will afterwards become?"<br/>
            If a man would often reflect thus, he would be able to dispel cares from his breast.

            If you can preserve the warmth of vitality in your heart when the world seems a cold and desolate place,<br/>

            An exalted Buddhist monk of ancient times once said,<br/>
            “The flickering shadow of a bamboo on steps cannot remove the dust from them.<br/>
            Moonbeams shining on a pond leave no traces on the water.”<br/>

            “Even with torrents raging and roaring, the quiet surroundings remain undisturbed.<br/>

            one can perceive the exquisitely beautiful pattern of Nature.

            When the grandee in his splendid attire sees how leisurely and poised an ordinary person is, although clad in peasant garb,<br/>
            he cannot help but sigh with envy.<br/>
            When a wealthy man gorging himself on a sumptuous feast catches sight of the carefree and happy family life of humble people living in their clean, neat hut,<br/>
            he cannot help but feel a pang of nostalgia.<br/>
            Why do people harness themselves like animals in order to pursue wealth and fame?<br/>
            This is like tying flaming torches to the tails of cattle to make them stampede or spurring horses to gallop at a lightning speed.<br/>
            They would be far better off living in accordance with their innate natures.

            An image which the mind grasps naturally becomes a beautiful land,<br/>

            you neither feel pleased when you accomplish something,<br/>
            nor do you feel downcast when you fail.<br/>
            Such a person never loses his equilibrium of mind no matter what situation he finds himself in.<br/>
            But when you let exterior things control you,<br/>
            then when things go contrary to your desires resentment wells up in your heart,<br/>
            and when things go in your favour you become deeply attached to them.<br/>
            In such a situation even a tiny thing can become a fetter binding you.

            When the idea of a thing is extinguished, the thing itself is extinguished.<br/>
            But when a person banishes a thing, and yet clings to the idea of it,<br/>
            this is like trying to get rid of the shadow while keeping the shape —<br/>
            the shape will still preserve its shadow.<br/>
            When the heart is made void (free from worldly thoughts),<br/>
            the environment it finds itself in will also become void.<br/>
            A person, who wishes to make his environment void without making his heart void first,<br/>
            is like a man who puts out a piece of carrion and tries to drive the mosquitoes and flies away —<br/>
            it will not succeed.

            he finds flute music without a player most entertaining,<br/>
            and a zither without strings producing the sweetest sound.<br/>
            To him chance meetings are the best,<br/>
            and guests who need neither welcoming nor seeing off are the most candid.<br/>
            To engage in any of these pursuits<br/>
            while rigidly adhering to mundane reasoning and formality<br/>
            condemns one to the sea of bitterness which is the world.

            Those who love quietude and hate noise<br/>
            often flee from the world of men, and seek solitude.<br/>
            They do not realize that by doing so,<br/>
            they have burdened themselves with fresh worries,<br/>
            which stem from a pursuit to exclude others,<br/>
            an effort that attaches too much importance to the physical existence of human beings.<br/>
            Seeking quietude causes anxiety to move away.<br/>
            So how can we in this case cultivate the ability<br/>
            to treat others like ourselves and forget all distinction between motion and stillness?

            Gazing upon a wisp of leisurely cloud or a flock of wild cranes can stimulate sublime thoughts.<br/>
            Coming across a gurgling stream or babbling brook can induce yearnings to dispel all foulness from both body and mind.<br/>
            Caressing a juniper or plum tree can in an instant spur the gushing forth of notions of sturdy integrity.<br/>
            With gulls and deer for companions, all traces of scheming and trickery vanish from the mind.<br/>
            But once back in worldly society, one not only becomes ensnared by external things, but also becomes an ornament for others.

            Happiness and sadness both spring from the mind.<br/>
            Thus, according to Buddhist teaching:<br/>
            “Greed is like a raging fire; it is a fiery pit.<br/>
            To immerse oneself in avarice and covetousness is to sink one’s body into a sea of bitterness,<br/>
            whereas seeking quietude can change the fiery pit into a cooling moat,<br/>
            and guarding against greed can guide the boat to shore.”<br/>
            From this, we can see that<br/>
            even a minute shift in thought can immediately change the world we find ourselves in.<br/>
            Does it not follow that we should exercise the utmost vigilance over our thoughts?

            For instance, by narrowing the circle of his friends he saves himself much to-ing and fro-ing, and<br/>
            by becoming a man of few words he reduces his chances of making mistakes.<br/>
            Moreover, by being sparing with his thoughts he saves wear and tear on his spirit,<br/>
            and by setting less store by cleverness he retains more of his natural essence.<br/>
            Those who do not seek daily to reduce their activities,<br/>
            but instead strive to increase them are forging manacles for themselves!

            It is easy to avoid the cold and the heat as the seasons change,<br/>
            but the inconstancy of human relations is difficult to eradicate.<br/>
            Even if it were easy to expunge it,<br/>
            the feelings of attachment and aversion in our hearts would still be difficult to get rid of.<br/>
            For if we could banish such feelings<br/>
            our whole being would be filled with the amiability which gives birth to the myriad things,<br/>
            and then it would be as if the breath of spring were blowing over the whole Earth.

            When drinking tea, it is not important to sip fine blends;<br/>
            what is important is to make sure that the teapot is never dry and that there is always tea to drink.<br/>
            When drinking wine, it is not important to savour the mellow products of famous vats;<br/>
            what is important is to make sure that the wine cup is never empty and that there is always wine to drink.<br/>
            Laying your hands on a lute, even though it has no strings, can soothe your mind.<br/>
            Holding a simple flute, even though it has no holes, can refresh your brain.<br/>
            Thus, although it would be difficult to surpass the wisdom of the ancient mythical emperor Fu Xi,<br/>
            by putting themselves in conformity with Nature,<br/>
            people could perhaps reach the level of Ji Kang and Ruan Ji,<br/>
            two of the sages widely admired in the Three Kingdoms Period of the 3rd century.

            Buddhism encourages people to let things follow their natural course;<br/>
            Confucianism teaches people to be contented with the present state of things.<br/>
            These two principles are the lifebelts which enable men to cross the sea of suffering.<br/>
            The roads of the vulgar world are vast and boundless;<br/>
            to seek perfection is to stir up a multitude of desires and problems.<br/>
            If you can adapt yourself with satisfaction to any situation that arises,<br/>
            then wherever you go you will find contentment.
