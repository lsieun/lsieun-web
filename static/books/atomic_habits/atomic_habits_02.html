            WHY IS IT so easy to repeat bad habits and so hard to form good ones?
            Few things can have a more powerful impact on your life than improving your daily habits.
            And yet it is likely that this time next year you’ll be doing the same thing rather than something better.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            It often feels difficult to keep good habits going for more than a few days,
            even with sincere effort and the occasional burst of motivation.
            Habits like exercise, meditation, journaling, and cooking are reasonable for a day or two and then become a hassle.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            However, once your habits are established, they seem to stick around forever—especially the unwanted ones.
            Despite our best intentions, unhealthy habits like eating junk food, watching too much television,
            procrastinating, and smoking can feel impossible to break.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            Changing our habits is challenging for two reasons:
            <span class="text-key-point">(1) we try to change the wrong thing</span> and
            <span class="text-key-point">(2) we try to change our habits in the wrong way.</span>
            In this chapter, I’ll address the first point.
            In the chapters that follow, I’ll answer the second.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            Our first mistake is that we try to change the wrong thing.
            To understand what I mean, consider that there are three levels at which change can occur.
            You can imagine them like the layers of an onion.
