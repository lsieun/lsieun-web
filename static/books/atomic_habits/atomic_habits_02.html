            WHY IS IT so easy to repeat bad habits and so hard to form good ones?
            Few things can have a more powerful impact on your life than improving your daily habits.
            And yet it is likely that this time next year you’ll be doing the same thing rather than something better.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            It often feels difficult to keep good habits going for more than a few days,
            even with sincere effort and the occasional burst of motivation.
            Habits like exercise, meditation, journaling, and cooking are reasonable for a day or two and then become a hassle.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            However, once your habits are established, they seem to stick around forever—especially the unwanted ones.
            Despite our best intentions, unhealthy habits like eating junk food, watching too much television,
            procrastinating, and smoking can feel impossible to break.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            Changing our habits is challenging for two reasons:
            <span class="text-key-point">(1) we try to change the wrong thing</span> and
            <span class="text-key-point">(2) we try to change our habits in the wrong way.</span>
            In this chapter, I’ll address the first point.
            In the chapters that follow, I’ll answer the second.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            Our first mistake is that we try to change the wrong thing.
            To understand what I mean, consider that there are three levels at which change can occur.
            You can imagine them like the layers of an onion.

        <h2>THREE LAYERS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGE</h2>
        <div class="w3-display-container w3-center">
            <img class="w3-image w3-center" src="images/figure003.png" alt=""/>
        </div>
        <p class="indented">
            <span class="text-emphasize">The first layer is changing your outcomes.</span>
            This level is concerned with changing your results: losing weight, publishing a book, winning a championship.
            Most of the goals you set are associated with this level of change.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：第一层，达成一个外在的结果</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            <span class="text-emphasize">The second layer is changing your process.</span>
            This level is concerned with changing your habits and systems:
            implementing a new routine at the gym, decluttering your desk for better workflow,
            developing a meditation practice.
            Most of the habits you build are associated with this level.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：第二层，行为习惯的改变</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            <span class="text-emphasize">The third and deepest layer is changing your identity.</span>
            This level is concerned with changing your beliefs:
            your worldview, your self-image, your judgments about yourself and others.
            Most of the beliefs, assumptions, and biases you hold are associated with this level.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：第三层，内心的转变</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            Outcomes are about what you get.
            Processes are about what you do.
            Identity is about what you believe.
            When it comes to building habits that last—when it comes to building a system of 1 percent
            improvements—the problem is not that one level is “better” or “worse” than another.
            All levels of change are useful in their own way.
            The problem is the <span class="text-emphasize">direction</span> of change.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：无论是在哪一个层次，只要努力的方向是对的，它都会起到积极的作用。</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            Many people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they want to achieve.
            This leads us to outcome-based habits.
            The alternative is to build identity-based habits.
            With this approach, we start by focusing on who we wish to become.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：在这里，我有这种感觉，outcome-based habits是向“外”驰求，而identity-based habits是向“内”寻求。我的态度，则是倾向于向“内”去求。</sub>
        </p>
        <div class="w3-display-container w3-center">
            <img class="w3-image w3-center" src="images/figure004.png" alt=""/>
        </div>
        <p class="indented">
            Imagine two people resisting a cigarette.
            When offered a smoke, the first person says, “No thanks. I’m trying to quit.”
            It sounds like a reasonable response, but this person still believes they are a smoker who is trying to be something else.
            They are hoping their behavior will change while carrying around the same beliefs.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：从内心转变，才是真正的转变。</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            The second person declines by saying, “No thanks. I’m not a smoker.”
            It’s a small difference, but this statement signals a shift in identity.
            Smoking was part of their former life, not their current one.
            They no longer identify as someone who smokes.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            Most people don’t even consider identity change when they set out to improve.
            They just think, “I want to be skinny (outcome) and if I stick to this diet, then I’ll be skinny (process).”
            They set goals and determine the actions they should take to achieve those goals without
            considering the beliefs that drive their actions.
            They never shift the way they look at themselves,
            and they don’t realize that their old identity can sabotage their new plans for change.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            <span class="text-key-point">Behind every system of actions are a system of beliefs.</span>
            The system of a democracy is founded on beliefs like freedom, majority rule, and social equality.
            The system of a dictatorship has a very different set of beliefs like absolute authority and strict obedience.
            You can imagine many ways to try to get more people to vote in a democracy,
            but such behavior change would never get off the ground in a dictatorship.
            That’s not the identity of the system.
            Voting is a behavior that is impossible under a certain set of beliefs.
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：这句话，真的让我觉得很重要。有的时候，与别人讲道理，会发现根本讲不通，是因为他这个人背后有a system of beliefs，他会本能的排斥你的想法。但反过来想，别人给我讲道理，我接受不了，会不会自己的内在认知阻碍了自己了解更广阔的东西呢？更明显的一个例子，就是中国的民众和美国的民众的思维状态就有非常大的差异。具体的例子，一个中国人要说自己爱美国，那就会有人说汉奸、走狗、卖国贼；如果有一个外国人说爱中国，那也会有人高兴的不得了，心想还是中国好呀。假如事情发生在美国，一个美国人说他爱中国，那么会有美国人说他“美奸”、走狗、卖国贼吗？</sub>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            A similar pattern exists whether we are discussing individuals, organizations, or societies.
            There are a set of beliefs and assumptions that shape the system, an identity behind the habits.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            <span class="text-key-point">Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last.</span>
            You may want more money, but if your identity is someone who consumes rather than creates,
            then you’ll continue to be pulled toward spending rather than earning.
            You may want better health, but if you continue to prioritize comfort over accomplishment,
            you’ll be drawn to relaxing rather than training.
            It’s hard to change your habits if you never change the underlying beliefs that led to your past behavior.
            You have a new goal and a new plan, but you haven’t changed who you are.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            The story of Brian Clark, an entrepreneur from Boulder, Colorado, provides a good example.
            “For as long as I can remember, I’ve chewed my fingernails,” Clark told me.
            “It started as a nervous habit when I was young, and then morphed into an undesirable grooming ritual.
            One day, I resolved to stop chewing my nails until they grew out a bit.
            Through mindful willpower alone, I managed to do it.”
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            Then, Clark did something surprising.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            “I asked my wife to schedule my first-ever manicure,” he said.
            “My thought was that if I started paying to maintain my nails, I wouldn't chew them.
            And it worked, but not for the monetary reason.
            What happened was the manicure made my fingers look really nice for the first time.
            The manicurist even said that—other than the chewing—I had really healthy, attractive nails.
            Suddenly, I was proud of my fingernails.
            And even though that’s something I had never aspired to, it made all the difference.
            I’ve never chewed my nails since; not even a single close call.
            And it’s because I now take pride in properly caring for them.”
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity.
            It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who wants this.
            It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person who is this.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity,
            the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it.
            If you’re proud of how your hair looks, you’ll develop all sorts of habits to care for and maintain it.
            If you’re proud of the size of your biceps, you’ll make sure you never skip an upper-body workout.
            If you’re proud of the scarves you knit, you’ll be more likely to spend hours knitting each week.
            Once your pride gets involved, you’ll fight tooth and nail to maintain your habits.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            <span class="text-key-point">True behavior change is identity change.</span>
            You might start a habit because of motivation,
            but the only reason you’ll stick with one is that it becomes part of your identity.
            Anyone can convince themselves to visit the gym or eat healthy once or twice,
            but if you don’t shift the belief behind the behavior,
            then it is hard to stick with long-term changes.
            Improvements are only temporary until they become part of who you are.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader.
            </li>
            <li>
                The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner.

            <li>
                The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become a musician.

        </ul>
        <p class="indented">
            <span class="text-key-point">Your behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity.</span>
            What you do is an indication of the type of person you believe that you are—either consciously or non-consciously.
            Research has shown that once a person believes in a particular aspect of their identity,
            they are more likely to act in alignment with that belief.
            For example, people who identified as “being a voter” were more likely to vote than those
            who simply claimed “voting” was an action they wanted to perform.
            Similarly, the person who incorporates exercise into their identity
            doesn't have to convince themselves to train.
            Doing the right thing is easy.
            <span class="text-key-point">After all, when your behavior and your identity are fully aligned,
            you are no longer pursuing behavior change.
                You are simply acting like the type of person you already believe yourself to be.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            Like all aspects of habit formation, this, too, is a double-edged sword.
            When working for you, identity change can be a powerful force for self-improvement.
            When working against you, though, identity change can be a curse.
            Once you have adopted an identity, it can be easy to let your allegiance to it impact your ability to change.
            Many people walk through life in a cognitive slumber, blindly following the norms attached to their identity.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>“I’m terrible with directions.”</li>
            <li>“I’m not a morning person.”</li>
            <li>“I’m bad at remembering people’s names.”</li>
            <li>“I’m always late.”</li>
            <li>“I’m not good with technology.”</li>
            <li>“I’m horrible at math.”</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="indented">
            ... and a thousand other variations.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            When you have repeated a story to yourself for years,
            it is easy to slide into these mental grooves and accept them as a fact.
            In time, you begin to resist certain actions because “that’s not who I am.”
            There is internal pressure to maintain your self-image and behave in a way that is consistent with your beliefs.
            You find whatever way you can to avoid contradicting yourself.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            The more deeply a thought or action is tied to your identity, the more difficult it is to change it.
            It can feel comfortable to believe what your culture believes (group identity) or to do what upholds your self-image (personal identity),
            even if it’s wrong.
            The biggest barrier to positive change at any level—individual, team, society—is identity conflict.
            Good habits can make rational sense, but if they conflict with your identity, you will fail to put them into action.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            On any given day, you may struggle with your habits because you’re too busy or too tired or too overwhelmed or hundreds of other reasons.
            Over the long run, however, the real reason you fail to stick with habits is that your self-image gets in the way.
            This is why you can’t get too attached to one version of your identity.
            Progress requires unlearning.
            Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            This brings us to an important question:
            If your beliefs and worldview play such an important role in your behavior,
            where do they come from in the first place?
            How, exactly, is your identity formed?
            And how can you emphasize new aspects of your identity that serve you and gradually erase the pieces that hinder you?
        </p>
        <hr/>



        <h2>THE TWO-STEP PROCESS TO CHANGING YOUR IDENTITY</h2>
        <p class="indented">
            Your identity emerges out of your habits.
            You are not born with preset beliefs.
            Every belief, including those about yourself, is learned and conditioned through experience.
