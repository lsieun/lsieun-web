            In 1898, A psychologist named Edward Thorndike conducted an experiment<br/>
            that would lay the foundation for our understanding of how habits form and the rules that guide our behavior.<br/>
            Thorndike was interested in studying the behavior of animals, and he started by working with cats.
        </p>
        <p>
            He would place each cat inside a device known as a puzzle box.<br/>
            The box was designed so that the cat could escape through a door “by some simple act,<br/>
            such as pulling at a loop of cord, pressing a lever, or stepping on a platform.”<br/>
            For example, one box contained a lever that, when pressed,<br/>
            would open a door on the side of the box.<br/>
            Once the door had been opened, the cat could dart out and run over to a bowl of food.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most cats wanted to escape as soon as they were placed inside the box.<br/>
            They would poke their nose into the corners, stick their paws through openings, and claw at loose objects.<br/>
            After a few minutes of exploration, the cats would happen to press the magical lever,<br/>
            the door would open, and they would escape.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thorndike tracked the behavior of each cat across many trials.<br/>
            In the beginning, the animals moved around the box at random.<br/>
            But as soon as the lever had been pressed and the door opened, the process of learning began.<br/>
            Gradually, each cat learned to associate the action of pressing the lever with<br/>
            the reward of escaping the box and getting to the food.
        </p>
        <p>
            After twenty to thirty trials,<br/>
            this behavior became so automatic and habitual that the cat could escape within a few seconds.<br/>
            For example, Thorndike noted, “Cat 12 took the following times to perform the act.<br/>
            160 seconds, 30 seconds, 90 seconds, 60, 15, 28, 20, 30, 22, 11, 15, 20, 12, 10, 14, 10, 8, 8, 5, 10, 8, 6, 6, 7.”
        </p>
        <p>
            During the first three trials, the cat escaped in an average of 1.5 minutes.<br/>
            During the last three trials, it escaped in an average of 6.3 seconds.<br/>
            With practice, each cat made fewer errors and their actions became quicker and more automatic.<br/>
            Rather than repeat the same mistakes, the cat began to cut straight to the solution.
        </p>
        <p>
            From his studies, Thorndike described the learning process by stating,<br/>
            “behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated and<br/>
            those that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated.”<br/>
            His work provides the perfect starting point for discussing how habits form in our own lives.<br/>
            It also provides answers to some fundamental questions like: What are habits?<br/>
            And why does the brain bother building them at all?

        <h2>WHY YOUR BRAIN BUILDS HABITS</h2>
        <p>
            A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic.<br/>
            The process of habit formation begins with trial and error.<br/>
            <span class="text-emphasize">Whenever you encounter a new situation in life, your brain has to make a decision.</span><br/>
            <span class="text-emphasize">How do I respond to this?</span><br/>
            The first time you come across a problem, you’re not sure how to solve it.<br/>
            Like Thorndike’s cat, you’re just trying things out to see what works.
        </p>
        <p>
            Neurological activity in the brain is high during this period.<br/>
            You are carefully analyzing the situation and making conscious decisions about how to act.<br/>
            You’re taking in tons of new information and trying to make sense of it all.<br/>
            The brain is busy learning the most effective course of action.
        </p>
        <p>
            Occasionally, like a cat pressing on a lever, you stumble across a solution.<br/>
            You’re feeling anxious, and you discover that going for a run calms you down.<br/>
            You’re mentally exhausted from a long day of work,<br/>
            and you learn that playing video games relaxes you.<br/>
            You’re exploring, exploring, exploring, and then—BAM—a reward.
        </p>
        <p>
            After you stumble upon an unexpected reward, you alter your strategy for next time.<br/>
            Your brain immediately begins to catalog the events that preceded the reward.<br/>
            Wait a minute—that felt good.<br/>
            What did I do right before that?
        </p>
        <p class="text-emphasize">
            This is the feedback loop behind all human behavior: try, fail, learn, try differently.<br/>
            With practice, the useless movements fade away and the useful actions get reinforced.<br/>
            That’s a habit forming.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whenever you face a problem repeatedly, your brain begins to automate the process of solving it.<br/>
            Your habits are just a series of automatic solutions that solve the problems and stresses you face regularly.<br/>
            As behavioral scientist Jason Hreha writes,<br/>
            “Habits are, simply, reliable solutions to recurring problems in our environment.”
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="text-emphasize">As habits are created, the level of activity in the brain decreases.</span><br/>
            You learn to lock in on the cues that predict success and tune out everything else.<br/>
            When a similar situation arises in the future, you know exactly what to look for.<br/>
            There is no longer a need to analyze every angle of a situation.<br/>
            Your brain skips the process of trial and error and creates a mental rule: if this, then that.<br/>
            These cognitive scripts can be followed automatically whenever the situation is appropriate.<br/>
            Now, whenever you feel stressed, you get the itch to run.<br/>
            As soon as you walk in the door from work, you grab the video game controller.<br/>
            A choice that once required effort is now automatic. A habit has been created.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="text-emphasize">Habits are mental shortcuts learned from experience.</span><br/>
            In a sense, a habit is just a memory of the steps you previously followed to solve a problem in the past.<br/>
            Whenever the conditions are right, you can draw on this memory and automatically apply the same solution.<br/>
            <span class="text-emphasize">The primary reason the brain remembers the past is to better predict what will work in the future.</span>
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：记忆过去，是为了更好的预测示来。</sub>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="text-emphasize">Habit formation is incredibly useful because the conscious mind is the bottleneck of the brain.</span><br/>
            It can only pay attention to one problem at a time.<br/>
            As a result, your brain is always working to preserve your conscious attention for whatever task is most essential.<br/>
            Whenever possible, the conscious mind likes to pawn off tasks to the non-conscious mind to do automatically.<br/>
            This is precisely what happens when a habit is formed.<br/>
            Habits reduce cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so you can allocate your attention to other tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite their efficiency, some people still wonder about the benefits of habits.<br/>
            The argument goes like this: “Will habits make my life dull?<br/>
            I don’t want to pigeonhole myself into a lifestyle I don’t enjoy.<br/>
            Doesn’t so much routine take away the vibrancy and spontaneity of life?”<br/>
            Hardly.<br/>
            Such questions set up a false dichotomy.<br/>
            They make you think that you have to choose between building habits and attaining freedom.<br/>
            In reality, the two complement each other.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="text-emphasize">Habits do not restrict freedom. They create it.</span><br/>
            In fact, the people who don’t have their habits handled are often the ones with the least amount of freedom.<br/>
            Without good financial habits, you will always be struggling for the next dollar.<br/>
            Without good health habits, you will always seem to be short on energy.<br/>
            Without good learning habits, you will always feel like you’re behind the curve.<br/>
            If you’re always being forced to make decisions about simple tasks—<br/>
            when should I work out,<br/>
            where do I go to write,<br/>
            when do I pay the bills—<br/>
            then you have less time for freedom.<br/>
            It’s only by making the fundamentals of life easier that<br/>
            you can create the mental space needed for free thinking and creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Conversely, when you have your habits dialed in and the basics of life are handled and done,<br/>
            your mind is free to focus on new challenges and master the next set of problems.<br/>
            Building habits in the present allows you to do more of what you want in the future.
        </p>

        <h2>THE SCIENCE OF HOW HABITS WORK</h2>
        <p>
            The process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps:<br/>
            <span class="text-emphasize">cue, craving, response, and reward.</span><br/>
            Breaking it down into these fundamental parts can help us understand<br/>
            what a habit is,<br/>
            how it works, and<br/>
            how to improve it.

        </div>
        <p>
            This four-step pattern is the backbone of every habit,<br/>
            and your brain runs through these steps in the same order each time.
