        <p>
            In 1898, A psychologist named Edward Thorndike conducted an experiment<br/>
            that would lay the foundation for our understanding of how habits form and the rules that guide our behavior.<br/>
            Thorndike was interested in studying the behavior of animals, and he started by working with cats.
        </p>
        <p>
            He would place each cat inside a device known as a puzzle box.<br/>
            The box was designed so that the cat could escape through a door “by some simple act,<br/>
            such as pulling at a loop of cord, pressing a lever, or stepping on a platform.”<br/>
            For example, one box contained a lever that, when pressed,<br/>
            would open a door on the side of the box.<br/>
            Once the door had been opened, the cat could dart out and run over to a bowl of food.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most cats wanted to escape as soon as they were placed inside the box.<br/>
            They would poke their nose into the corners, stick their paws through openings, and claw at loose objects.<br/>
            After a few minutes of exploration, the cats would happen to press the magical lever,<br/>
            the door would open, and they would escape.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thorndike tracked the behavior of each cat across many trials.<br/>
            In the beginning, the animals moved around the box at random.<br/>
            But as soon as the lever had been pressed and the door opened, the process of learning began.<br/>
            Gradually, each cat learned to associate the action of pressing the lever with<br/>
            the reward of escaping the box and getting to the food.
        </p>
        <p>
            After twenty to thirty trials,<br/>
            this behavior became so automatic and habitual that the cat could escape within a few seconds.<br/>
            For example, Thorndike noted, “Cat 12 took the following times to perform the act.<br/>
            160 seconds, 30 seconds, 90 seconds, 60, 15, 28, 20, 30, 22, 11, 15, 20, 12, 10, 14, 10, 8, 8, 5, 10, 8, 6, 6, 7.”
        </p>
        <p>
            During the first three trials, the cat escaped in an average of 1.5 minutes.<br/>
            During the last three trials, it escaped in an average of 6.3 seconds.<br/>
            With practice, each cat made fewer errors and their actions became quicker and more automatic.<br/>
            Rather than repeat the same mistakes, the cat began to cut straight to the solution.
        </p>
        <p>
            From his studies, Thorndike described the learning process by stating,<br/>
            “behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated and<br/>
            those that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated.”<br/>
            His work provides the perfect starting point for discussing how habits form in our own lives.<br/>
            It also provides answers to some fundamental questions like: What are habits?<br/>
            And why does the brain bother building them at all?
        </p>
        <hr/>


        <h2>WHY YOUR BRAIN BUILDS HABITS</h2>
        <p>
            A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic.<br/>
            The process of habit formation begins with trial and error.<br/>
            <span class="text-emphasize">Whenever you encounter a new situation in life, your brain has to make a decision.</span><br/>
            <span class="text-emphasize">How do I respond to this?</span><br/>
            The first time you come across a problem, you’re not sure how to solve it.<br/>
            Like Thorndike’s cat, you’re just trying things out to see what works.
        </p>
        <p>
            Neurological activity in the brain is high during this period.<br/>
            You are carefully analyzing the situation and making conscious decisions about how to act.<br/>
            You’re taking in tons of new information and trying to make sense of it all.<br/>
            The brain is busy learning the most effective course of action.
        </p>
        <p>
            Occasionally, like a cat pressing on a lever, you stumble across a solution.<br/>
            You’re feeling anxious, and you discover that going for a run calms you down.<br/>
            You’re mentally exhausted from a long day of work,<br/>
            and you learn that playing video games relaxes you.<br/>
            You’re exploring, exploring, exploring, and then—BAM—a reward.
        </p>
        <p>
            After you stumble upon an unexpected reward, you alter your strategy for next time.<br/>
            Your brain immediately begins to catalog the events that preceded the reward.<br/>
            Wait a minute—that felt good.<br/>
            What did I do right before that?
        </p>
        <p class="text-emphasize">
            This is the feedback loop behind all human behavior: try, fail, learn, try differently.<br/>
            With practice, the useless movements fade away and the useful actions get reinforced.<br/>
            That’s a habit forming.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whenever you face a problem repeatedly, your brain begins to automate the process of solving it.<br/>
            Your habits are just a series of automatic solutions that solve the problems and stresses you face regularly.<br/>
            As behavioral scientist Jason Hreha writes,<br/>
            “Habits are, simply, reliable solutions to recurring problems in our environment.”
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="text-emphasize">As habits are created, the level of activity in the brain decreases.</span><br/>
            You learn to lock in on the cues that predict success and tune out everything else.<br/>
            When a similar situation arises in the future, you know exactly what to look for.<br/>
            There is no longer a need to analyze every angle of a situation.<br/>
            Your brain skips the process of trial and error and creates a mental rule: if this, then that.<br/>
            These cognitive scripts can be followed automatically whenever the situation is appropriate.<br/>
            Now, whenever you feel stressed, you get the itch to run.<br/>
            As soon as you walk in the door from work, you grab the video game controller.<br/>
            A choice that once required effort is now automatic. A habit has been created.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="text-emphasize">Habits are mental shortcuts learned from experience.</span><br/>
            In a sense, a habit is just a memory of the steps you previously followed to solve a problem in the past.<br/>
            Whenever the conditions are right, you can draw on this memory and automatically apply the same solution.<br/>
            <span class="text-emphasize">The primary reason the brain remembers the past is to better predict what will work in the future.</span>
            <sub class="my_note" style="color:blue">笔记：记忆过去，是为了更好的预测示来。</sub>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="text-emphasize">Habit formation is incredibly useful because the conscious mind is the bottleneck of the brain.</span><br/>
            It can only pay attention to one problem at a time.<br/>
            As a result, your brain is always working to preserve your conscious attention for whatever task is most essential.<br/>
            Whenever possible, the conscious mind likes to pawn off tasks to the non-conscious mind to do automatically.<br/>
            This is precisely what happens when a habit is formed.<br/>
            Habits reduce cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so you can allocate your attention to other tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite their efficiency, some people still wonder about the benefits of habits.<br/>
            The argument goes like this: “Will habits make my life dull?<br/>
            I don’t want to pigeonhole myself into a lifestyle I don’t enjoy.<br/>
            Doesn’t so much routine take away the vibrancy and spontaneity of life?”<br/>
            Hardly.<br/>
            Such questions set up a false dichotomy.<br/>
            They make you think that you have to choose between building habits and attaining freedom.<br/>
            In reality, the two complement each other.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="text-emphasize">Habits do not restrict freedom. They create it.</span><br/>
            In fact, the people who don’t have their habits handled are often the ones with the least amount of freedom.<br/>
            Without good financial habits, you will always be struggling for the next dollar.<br/>
            Without good health habits, you will always seem to be short on energy.<br/>
            Without good learning habits, you will always feel like you’re behind the curve.<br/>
            If you’re always being forced to make decisions about simple tasks—<br/>
            when should I work out,<br/>
            where do I go to write,<br/>
            when do I pay the bills—<br/>
            then you have less time for freedom.<br/>
            It’s only by making the fundamentals of life easier that<br/>
            you can create the mental space needed for free thinking and creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Conversely, when you have your habits dialed in and the basics of life are handled and done,<br/>
            your mind is free to focus on new challenges and master the next set of problems.<br/>
            Building habits in the present allows you to do more of what you want in the future.
        </p>

        <h2>THE SCIENCE OF HOW HABITS WORK</h2>
        <p>
            The process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps:<br/>
            <span class="text-emphasize">cue, craving, response, and reward.</span><br/>
            Breaking it down into these fundamental parts can help us understand<br/>
            what a habit is,<br/>
            how it works, and<br/>
            how to improve it.
        </p>
        <div class="w3-display-container w3-left-align">
            <img class="w3-image" src="images/figure005.png" alt=""/>
        </div>
        <p>
            This four-step pattern is the backbone of every habit,<br/>
            and your brain runs through these steps in the same order each time.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="text-emphasize">First, there is the cue.</span><br/>
            <span class="text-emphasize">The cue triggers your brain to initiate a behavior.</span><br/>
            <span class="text-emphasize">It is a bit of information that predicts a reward.</span><br/>
            Our prehistoric ancestors were paying attention to cues that signaled the location of primary rewards like food, water, and sex.<br/>
            Today, we spend most of our time learning cues that predict secondary rewards like<br/>
            money and fame, power and status, praise and approval, love and friendship, or a sense of personal satisfaction.<br/>
            (Of course, these pursuits also indirectly improve our odds of survival and reproduction,<br/>
            which is the deeper motive behind everything we do.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Your mind is continuously analyzing your internal and external environment for hints of where rewards are located.<br/>
            Because the cue is the first indication that we’re close to a reward, it naturally leads to a craving.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="text-emphasize">Cravings are the second step, and they are the motivational force behind every habit.</span><br/>
            Without some level of motivation or desire— without craving a change—we have no reason to act.<br/>
            What you crave is not the habit itself but the change in state it delivers.<br/>
            You do not crave smoking a cigarette, you crave the feeling of relief it provides.<br/>
            You are not motivated by brushing your teeth but rather by the feeling of a clean mouth.<br/>
            You do not want to turn on the television, you want to be entertained.<br/>
            <span class="text-emphasize">Every craving is linked to a desire to change your internal state.</span><br/>
            This is an important point that we will discuss in detail later.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="text-emphasize">Cravings differ from person to person.</span><br/>
            In theory, any piece of information could trigger a craving,<br/>
            but in practice, people are not motivated by the same cues.<br/>
            For a gambler, the sound of slot machines can be a potent trigger that sparks an intense wave of desire.<br/>
            For someone who rarely gambles, the jingles and chimes of the casino are just background noise.<br/>
            <span class="text-emphasize">Cues are meaningless until they are interpreted.</span><br/>
            <span class="text-emphasize">The thoughts, feelings, and emotions of the observer are what transform a cue into a craving.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="text-emphasize">The third step is the response.</span><br/>
            <span class="text-emphasize">The response is the actual habit you perform, which can take the form of a thought or an action.</span><br/>
            Whether a response occurs depends on how motivated you are and how much friction is associated with the behavior.<br/>
            If a particular action requires more physical or mental effort than you are willing to expend, then you won’t do it.<br/>
            Your response also depends on your ability.<br/>
            It sounds simple, but a habit can occur only if you are capable of doing it.<br/>
            If you want to dunk a basketball but can’t jump high enough to reach the hoop, well, you’re out of luck.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="text-emphasize">Finally, the response delivers a reward.</span><br/>
            Rewards are the end goal of every habit.<br/>
            The cue is about noticing the reward.<br/>
            The craving is about wanting the reward.<br/>
            The response is about obtaining the reward.<br/>
            We chase rewards because they serve two purposes: (1) they satisfy us and (2) they teach us.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="text-emphasize">The first purpose of rewards is to satisfy your craving.</span><br/>
            Yes, rewards provide benefits on their own.<br/>
            Food and water deliver the energy you need to survive.<br/>
            Getting a promotion brings more money and respect.<br/>
            Getting in shape improves your health and your dating prospects.<br/>
            But the more immediate benefit is that rewards satisfy your craving to eat or to gain status or to win approval.<br/>
            At least for a moment, rewards deliver contentment and relief from craving.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="text-emphasize">Second, rewards teach us which actions are worth remembering in the future.</span><br/>
            Your brain is a reward detector.<br/>
            As you go about your life, your sensory nervous system is continuously monitoring<br/>
            which actions satisfy your desires and deliver pleasure.<br/>
            Feelings of pleasure and disappointment are part of the feedback mechanism<br/>
            that helps your brain distinguish useful actions from useless ones.<br/>
            Rewards close the feedback loop and complete the habit cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
            If a behavior is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a habit.<br/>
            Eliminate the cue and your habit will never start.<br/>
            Reduce the craving and you won’t experience enough motivation to act.<br/>
            Make the behavior difficult and you won’t be able to do it.<br/>
            And if the reward fails to satisfy your desire, then you’ll have no reason to do it again in the future.<br/>
            Without the first three steps, a behavior will not occur.<br/>
            Without all four, a behavior will not be repeated.
        </p>
        <hr/>


        <h2>THE HABIT LOOP</h2>
        <div class="w3-display-container w3-left-align">
            <img class="w3-image" src="images/figure006.png" alt=""/>
        </div>
        <p>
            In summary, the cue triggers a craving,<br/>
            which motivates a response,<br/>
            which provides a reward,<br/>
            which satisfies the craving and,<br/>
            ultimately, becomes associated with the cue.<br/>
            Together, these four steps form a neurological feedback loop—cue, craving, response, reward;<br/>
            cue, craving, response, reward—that ultimately allows you to create automatic habits.<br/>
            This cycle is known as the habit loop.
        </p>
        <p>
            This four-step process is not something that happens occasionally,<br/>
            but rather it is an endless feedback loop that is running and active during every moment you are alive—even now.<br/>
            The brain is continually scanning the environment, predicting what will happen next,<br/>
            trying out different responses, and learning from the results.<br/>
            The entire process is completed in a split second, and we use it again and again<br/>
            without realizing everything that has been packed into the previous moment.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can split these four steps into two phases: <span class="text-compare-grey">the problem phase</span> and <span class="text-compare-grey">the solution phase</span>.<br/>
            <span class="text-compare-grey">The problem phase</span> includes the cue and the craving, and it is when you realize that something needs to change.<br/>
            <span class="text-compare-grey">The solution phase</span> includes the response and the reward, and it is when you take action and achieve the change you desire.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            All behavior is driven by the desire to solve a problem.<br/>
            Sometimes the problem is that you notice something good and you want to obtain it.<br/>
            Sometimes the problem is that you are experiencing pain and you want to relieve it.<br/>
            Either way, the purpose of every habit is to solve the problems you face.
        </p>

        <h2>THE FOUR LAWS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGE</h2>
        <p>
            In the following chapters, we will see time and again<br/>
            how the four stages of cue, craving, response, and reward influence nearly everything we do each day.<br/>
            But before we do that, we need to transform these four steps into a practical framework<br/>
            that we can use to design good habits and eliminate bad ones.
        </p>
        <p>
            I refer to this framework as the <span class="text-emphasize">Four Laws of Behavior Change</span>,<br/>
            and it provides a simple set of rules for creating good habits and breaking bad ones.<br/>
            You can think of each law as a lever that influences human behavior.<br/>
            When the levers are in the right positions, creating good habits is effortless.<br/>
            When they are in the wrong positions, it is nearly impossible.
        </p>
        <div class="w3-display-container w3-left-align">
            <img class="w3-image" src="images/how_to_create_a_good_habit.png" alt=""/>
        </div>
        <p>
            We can invert these laws to learn how to break a bad habit.
        </p>
        <div class="w3-display-container w3-left-align">
            <img class="w3-image" src="images/how_to_break_a_bad_habit.png" alt=""/>
        </div>
        <p>
            It would be irresponsible for me to claim that<br/>
            these four laws are an exhaustive framework for changing any human behavior, but I think they’re close.<br/>
            As you will soon see, the <span class="text-emphasize">Four Laws of Behavior Change</span> apply to nearly every field,<br/>
            from sports to politics, art to medicine, comedy to management.<br/>
            These laws can be used no matter what challenge you are facing.<br/>
            There is no need for completely different strategies for each habit.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whenever you want to change your behavior, you can simply ask yourself:
        </p>
        <ol>

            If you have ever wondered,<br/>
            “Why don’t I do what I say I’m going to do?<br/>
            Why don’t I lose the weight or stop smoking or save for retirement or start that side business?<br/>
            Why do I say something is important but never seem to make time for it?”<br/>
            The answers to those questions can be found somewhere in these four laws.<br/>
            <span class="text-emphasize">The key to creating good habits and breaking bad ones is to<br/>
            understand these fundamental laws and how to alter them to your specifications.<br/>
            Every goal is doomed to fail if it goes against the grain of human nature.</span>

        <p>
            Your habits are shaped by the systems in your life.<br/>
            In the chapters that follow, we will discuss these laws one by one and<br/>
            show how you can use them to create a system<br/>
            in which good habits emerge naturally and bad habits wither away.

        <ul>
            <li>
                A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic.
            </li>
            <li>
                The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible.
            </li>
            <li>
                Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Four Laws of Behavior Change are a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits.
                They are (1) make it obvious, (2) make it attractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying.
