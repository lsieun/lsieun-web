            In 1898, A psychologist named Edward Thorndike conducted an experiment<br/>
            that would lay the foundation for our understanding of how habits form and the rules that guide our behavior.<br/>
            Thorndike was interested in studying the behavior of animals, and he started by working with cats.
        </p>
        <p>
            He would place each cat inside a device known as a puzzle box.<br/>
            The box was designed so that the cat could escape through a door “by some simple act,<br/>
            such as pulling at a loop of cord, pressing a lever, or stepping on a platform.”<br/>
            For example, one box contained a lever that, when pressed,<br/>
            would open a door on the side of the box.<br/>
            Once the door had been opened, the cat could dart out and run over to a bowl of food.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most cats wanted to escape as soon as they were placed inside the box.<br/>
            They would poke their nose into the corners, stick their paws through openings, and claw at loose objects.<br/>
            After a few minutes of exploration, the cats would happen to press the magical lever,<br/>
            the door would open, and they would escape.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thorndike tracked the behavior of each cat across many trials.<br/>
            In the beginning, the animals moved around the box at random.<br/>
            But as soon as the lever had been pressed and the door opened, the process of learning began.<br/>
            Gradually, each cat learned to associate the action of pressing the lever with<br/>
            the reward of escaping the box and getting to the food.
        </p>
        <p>
            After twenty to thirty trials,<br/>
            this behavior became so automatic and habitual that the cat could escape within a few seconds.<br/>
            For example, Thorndike noted, “Cat 12 took the following times to perform the act.<br/>
            160 seconds, 30 seconds, 90 seconds, 60, 15, 28, 20, 30, 22, 11, 15, 20, 12, 10, 14, 10, 8, 8, 5, 10, 8, 6, 6, 7.”
        </p>
        <p>
            During the first three trials, the cat escaped in an average of 1.5 minutes.<br/>
            During the last three trials, it escaped in an average of 6.3 seconds.<br/>
            With practice, each cat made fewer errors and their actions became quicker and more automatic.<br/>
            Rather than repeat the same mistakes, the cat began to cut straight to the solution.
        </p>
        <p>
            From his studies, Thorndike described the learning process by stating,<br/>
            “behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated and<br/>
            those that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated.”<br/>
            His work provides the perfect starting point for discussing how habits form in our own lives.<br/>
            It also provides answers to some fundamental questions like: What are habits?<br/>
            And why does the brain bother building them at all?

        <h2>WHY YOUR BRAIN BUILDS HABITS</h2>
        <p>
            A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic.<br/>
            The process of habit formation begins with trial and error.<br/>
            <span class="text-emphasize">Whenever you encounter a new situation in life, your brain has to make a decision.</span><br/>
            <span class="text-emphasize">How do I respond to this?</span><br/>
            The first time you come across a problem, you’re not sure how to solve it.<br/>
            Like Thorndike’s cat, you’re just trying things out to see what works.
