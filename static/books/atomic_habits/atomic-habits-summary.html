        <h2>What are Habits?</h2>

        <div class="w3-panel w3-pale-green w3-bottombar w3-border-green w3-border">
            <p>
                “All big things come from small beginnings.
                The seed of every habit is a single, tiny decision.
                But as that decision is repeated, a habit sprouts and grows stronger.
                Roots entrench themselves and branches grow.
                The task of breaking a bad habit is like uprooting a powerful oak within us.
                And the task of building a good habit is like cultivating a delicate flower one day at a time.”

        <h2>Forget about Goals, Concentrate on Systems</h2>

        <div class="w3-panel w3-pale-green w3-bottombar w3-border-green w3-border">
            <p>
                “You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results.”
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="w3-panel w3-pale-green w3-bottombar w3-border-green w3-border">
            <p>
                “When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock,
                perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it.
                Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two,
                and I know it was not that last blow that did it—but all that had gone before.”

        <h2>How to Form Good Habits</h2>

        <div class="w3-panel w3-pale-green w3-bottombar w3-border-green w3-border">
            <p>
                “The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity,
                the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it.
                If you’re proud of how your hair looks, you’ll develop all sorts of habits to care for and maintain it.
                If you’re proud of the size of your biceps, you’ll make sure you never skip an upper-body workout.
                If you’re proud of the scarves you knit, you’ll be more likely to spend hours knitting each week.
                Once your pride gets involved, you’ll fight tooth and nail to maintain your habits.”

        <h2>How to Keep Your Habits on Track</h2>

        <div class="w3-panel w3-pale-green w3-bottombar w3-border-green w3-border">
            <p>
                “Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.
                No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up,
                so does the evidence of your new identity.”
