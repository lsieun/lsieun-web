            The psychologist Gary Klein once told me a story about a woman who attended a family gathering.<br/>
            She had spent years working as a paramedic and, upon arriving at the event,<br/>
            took one look at her father-in-law and got very concerned.
        </p>
        <p>
            “I don’t like the way you look,” she said.
        </p>
        <p>
            Her father-in-law, who was feeling perfectly fine, jokingly replied,
            “Well, I don’t like your looks, either.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “No,” she insisted. “You need to go to the hospital now.”
        </p>
        <p>
            A few hours later, the man was undergoing lifesaving surgery after an examination had revealed that<br/>
            he had a blockage to a major artery and was at immediate risk of a heart attack.<br/>
            Without his daughter-in-law’s intuition, he could have died.
        </p>
        <p>
            What did the paramedic see? How did she predict his impending heart attack?
        </p>
        <p>
            When major arteries are obstructed,<br/>
            the body focuses on sending blood to critical organs and away from peripheral locations near the surface of the skin.<br/>
            The result is a change in the pattern of distribution of blood in the face.<br/>
            After many years of working with people with heart failure,<br/>
            the woman had unknowingly developed the ability to recognize this pattern on sight.<br/>
            She couldn’t explain what it was that she noticed in her father-in-law’s face,<br/>
            but she knew something was wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
            Similar stories exist in other fields.<br/>
            For example, military analysts can identify<br/>
            which blip on a radar screen is an enemy missile and<br/>
            which one is a plane from their own fleet<br/>
            even though they are traveling at the same speed, flying at the same altitude,<br/>
            and look identical on radar in nearly every respect.<br/>
            During the Gulf War, Lieutenant Commander Michael Riley saved an entire battleship<br/>
            when he ordered a missile shot down—despite the fact that<br/>
            it looked exactly like the battleship’s own planes on radar.<br/>
            He made the right call, but even his superior officers couldn't explain how he did it.

            Museum curators have been known to discern the difference between an authentic piece of art and an expertly produced counterfeit<br/>
            even though they can’t tell you precisely which details tipped them off.<br/>
            Experienced radiologists can look at a brain scan and predict the area<br/>
            where a stroke will develop before any obvious signs are visible to the untrained eye.<br/>
            I’ve even heard of hairdressers noticing<br/>
            whether a client is pregnant based only on the feel of her hair.

            <span class="text-emphasize">The human brain is a prediction machine.</span><br/>
            It is continuously taking in your surroundings and analyzing the information it comes across.<br/>
            Whenever you experience something repeatedly—<br/>
            like a paramedic seeing the face of a heart attack patient or<br/>
            a military analyst seeing a missile on a radar screen—<br/>
            your brain begins noticing what is important, sorting through the details and<br/>
            highlighting the relevant cues, and cataloging that information for future use.
